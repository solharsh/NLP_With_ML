      "Madam Speaker,\n",
      "\n",
      "            I rise to present the Union Budget for 2010-11.\n",
      "\n",
      "            In 2009, when I presented the interim Budget in February and the regular Budget in July in this august House, the Indian economy was facing grave uncertainties. Growth had started decelerating and the business sentiment was weak. The economy's capacity to sustain high growth was under serious threat from the widespread economic slowdown in the developed world.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.          It was not clear to us, as also to the policy makers in many other countries, how this crisis would eventually unfold. What would be its impact on the growth momentum of the Indian economy?  How soon will we be able to turnaround the fortunes of our economy? The short term global outlook was bleak and the consensus was that year 2009 would face the brunt of this crisis across the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.          At home, there was added uncertainty on account of the delayed and sub-normal south-west monsoon, which had undermined the kharif crop in the country.  There were concerns about production and prices of food items and its possible repercussions on the growth of rural demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.          Today, as I stand before you, I can say with confidence that we have weathered these crises well. Indian economy now is in a far better position than it was a year ago. That is not to say that the challenges today are any less than what they were nine months ago when UPA under the leadership of Mrs Sonia Gandhi was elected back to power and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh formed the Government for the second term.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.          The three challenges and the medium term perspective that I had outlined in my last Budget Speech remain relevant, even today. These would continue to engage the Indian policy-planners for the next few years.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.          The first challenge before us is to quickly revert to the high GDP growth path of 9 per cent and then find the means to cross the 'double digit growth barrier'. This calls for imparting a fresh momentum to the impressive recovery in growth witnessed in the past few months. In this endeavour, I seek Lord Indra's help to make the recovery more broad-based in the coming months.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.          Growth is only as important as what it enables us to do and be. Therefore, the second challenge is to harness economic growth to consolidate the recent gains in making development more inclusive. The thrust imparted to the development of infrastructure in rural areas has to be pursued to achieve the desired objectives within a fixed time frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.          We have to strengthen food security, improve education opportunities and provide health facilities at the level of households, both in rural and urban areas. These are issues that require significant resources, and we have to find those resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "9.          The third challenge relates to the weaknesses in government systems, structures and institutions at different levels of governance. Indeed, in the coming years, if there is one factor that can hold us back in realising our potential as a modern nation, it is the bottleneck of our public delivery mechanisms. There have been many initiatives in this regard, in different sectors, at different points of time. Some of them have been effective in reforming the way the Government works in those areas. But we have a long way to go before we can rest on this count.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.        The Union Budget cannot be a mere statement of Government accounts. It has to reflect the Government's vision and signal the policies to come in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "11.        With development and economic reforms, the focus of economic activity has shifted towards the non-governmental actors, bringing into sharper focus the role of Government as an enabler.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.        An enabling Government does not try to deliver directly to the citizens everything that they need. Instead it creates an enabling ethos so that individual enterprise and creativity can flourish. Government concentrates on supporting and delivering services to the disadvantaged sections of the society.\n",
      "\n",
      "13.        It is this broad conceptualisation of the Budget that informs my speech today. I would now begin by presenting a brief overview of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview of the Economy\n",
      "\n",
      "14.        Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey, which gives a detailed analysis of the economic situation of the country over the past twelve months.  I intend to highlight only a few salient features that form the backdrop of this Budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "15.        The fiscal year 2009-10 was a challenging year for the Indian economy. The significant deceleration in the second half of 2008-09, brought the real GDP growth down to 6.7 per cent, from an average of over 9 per cent in the preceding three years. We were among the first few countries in the world to implement a broad-based counter-cyclic policy package to respond to the negative fallout of the global slowdown. It included a substantial fiscal expansion along with liberal monetary policy support.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.        The effectiveness of these policy measures became evident with fast paced recovery. The economy stabilised in the first quarter of 2009-10 itself, when it clocked a GDP growth of 6.1 per cent, as against 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. It registered a strong rebound in the second quarter, when the growth rate rose to 7.9 per cent. With the Advance Estimates placing the likely growth for 2009-10 at 7.2 per cent, we are indeed vindicated in our policy stand. The final figure may well turn out to be higher when the third and fourth quarter GDP estimates for 2009-10 become available.\n",
      "\n",
      "17.        This recovery is very encouraging for it has come about despite a negative growth in the agriculture sector.  More importantly, it is the result of a renewed momentum in the manufacturing sector and marks the rise of this sector as the growth driver of the economy. The growth rate in manufacturing in December 2009 was 18.5 per centâ€” the highest in the past two decades. There are also signs of a turnaround in the merchandise exports with a positive growth in November and December 2009 after a decline of about twelve successive months. Export figures for January are also encouraging.  Significant private investment can now be expected to provide the engine for sustaining a growth of 9 per cent per annum. With some luck, I hope to breach the 10 per cent mark in not-too-distant a future.\n",
      "\n",
      "18.        A major concern during the second half of 2009-10 has been the emergence of double digit food inflation. There was a momentum in food prices since the flare-up of global commodity prices preceding the financial crisis in 2008, but it was expected that the agriculture season beginning June 2009 would help in moderating the food inflation. However, the erratic monsoons and drought like conditions in large parts of the country reinforced the supply side bottlenecks in some of the essential commodities. This set in motion inflationary expectations. Since December 2009, there have been indications of these high food prices, together with the gradual hardening of the fuel product prices, getting transmitted to other non-food items as well. The inflation data for January seems to have confirmed this trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "19.        Government is acutely conscious of this situation and has set in motion steps, in consultation with the State Chief Ministers, which should bring down the inflation in the next few months and ensure that there is better management of food security in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONSOLIDATING  GROWTH\n",
      "\n",
      "20.       Managing a complex economy is a difficult task, more so when it is a growing economy in a globalised world. And yet, choices have to be made and they have to be well-timed.\n",
      "\n",
      "21.        After successfully managing the effects of the global slowdown, we need to strengthen the domestic macroeconomic environment to help consolidate the rebound in growth and sustain it over the medium term. We need to review the stimulus imparted to the economy and move towards the preferred path of fiscal consolidation that facilitated the remarkable growth in the pre-crisis five year period.  We need to make growth more broad-based and ensure that supply-demand imbalances are better managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiscal Consolidation\n",
      "\n",
      "22.        The success of the fiscal stimulus in supporting domestic demand could be traced to its composition. The approach of the Government was to increase the disposable income in the hands of the people by effecting reductions in indirect taxes and by expanding public expenditure on programmes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and rural infrastructure. Now that the recovery has taken root, there is a need to review public spending, mobilise resources and gear them towards building the productivity of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.        In shaping the fiscal policy for 2010-11, I have acted on the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission. It has recommended a calibrated exit strategy from the expansionary fiscal stance of last two years. The Commission has recommended a capping of the combined debt of the Centre and the States at 68 per cent of the GDP to be achieved by 2014-15.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.        As a part of the fiscal consolidation process, it would be for the first time that the Government would target an explicit reduction in its domestic public debt-GDP ratio. I intend to bring out, within six months, a status paper giving a detailed analysis of the situation and a road map for curtailing the overall public debt. This would be followed by an annual report on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tax reforms\n",
      "\n",
      "25.        I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that the process for building a simple tax system with minimum exemptions and low rates designed to promote voluntary compliance, is now nearing completion. On the Direct Tax Code the wide-ranging discussions with stakeholders have been concluded.  I am confident that the Government will be in a position to implement the Direct Tax Code from April 1, 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "26.        On Goods and Services Tax, we have been focusing on generating a wide consensus on its design. In November, 2009 the Empowered Committee of the State Finance Ministers placed the first discussion paper on GST in the public domain. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has also made a number of significant recommendations relating to GST, which will contribute to the ongoing discussions. We are actively engaged with the Empowered Committee to finalise the structure of GST as well as the modalities of its expeditious implementation. It will be my earnest endeavour to introduce GST along with the DTC in April, 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "People's ownership of PSUs\n",
      "\n",
      "27.        While presenting the Budget for 2009-10, I invited people to participate in Government's disinvestment programme to share in the wealth and prosperity of the Central Public Sector Undertakings.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.        Since then, ownership has been broad based in Oil India Limited, NHPC, NTPC and Rural Electrification Corporation while the process is on for National Mineral Development Corporation and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam. The Government will raise about Rs.25,000 crore during the current year. Through this process, I propose to raise a higher amount during the year 2010-11. The proceeds will be utilised to meet the capital expenditure requirements of social sector schemes for creating new assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "29.        Listing of Central Public Sector Undertakings improves corporate governance, besides unlocking the value for all stakeholdersâ€”the government, the company and the shareholders. Market capitalization of five companies which have been listed since October, 2004 has increased by 3.8 times from the book value of Rs.78,841 crore to Rs.2,98,929 crore.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.        The effective management of public expenditure by bringing it in line with the Government's objectives is a part of the fiscal consolidation process. This calls for proper targeting of subsidies and expenditure adjustment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fertiliser subsidy\n",
      "\n",
      "31.        I had announced the intent of the Government for the fertiliser sector in my Budget Speech of 2009. A Nutrient Based Subsidy policy for the fertiliser sector has since been approved by the Government and will become effective from April 1, 2010. This policy is expected to promote balanced fertilization through new fortified products and focus on extension services by the fertiliser industry. This will lead to an increase in agricultural productivity and consequently better returns for the farmers. Over time, the policy is expected to reduce volatility in the demand for fertiliser subsidy in addition to containing the subsidy bill. Government will ensure that nutrient based fertiliser prices for transition year 2010-11, will remain around MRPs currently prevailing. The new system will move towards direct transfer of subsidies to the farmers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petroleum and Diesel pricing policy\n",
      "\n",
      "32.        In the last Budget, the constitution of an Expert Group, to advise the Government on a viable and sustainable system of pricing of petroleum products, was announced.  The Group headed by Shri Kirit Parikh has submitted its recommendations to the Government.  Decision on these recommendations will be taken by my colleague, the Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, in due course.\n",
      "\n",
      "33.        I am very happy to inform the Honourable Members that we have not only adhered to the fiscal roadmap that I had presented as a part of the Budget documents last year, but we have improved upon it. Except for meeting the liabilities of the year 2008-09, we have not issued oil or fertiliser bonds. I shall come to the numbers when I refer to the budget estimates a little later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improving Investment Environment\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign Direct Investment\n",
      "\n",
      "34.        Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows during the year have been steady in spite of the decline in global capital flows. India received FDI equity inflows of US$ 20.9 billion during April-December, 2009 compared to US$ 21.1 billion during the same period last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "35.        Government has taken a number of steps to simplify the FDI regime to make it easily comprehensible to foreign investors. For the first time, both ownership and control have been recognised as central to the FDI policy, and methodology for calculation of indirect foreign investment in Indian companies has been clearly defined. A consistent policy on downstream investment has also been formulated. Another major initiative has been the complete liberalization of pricing and payment of technology transfer fee, trademark, brand name and royalty payments. These payments can now be made under the automatic route.\n",
      "\n",
      "36.        Government also intends to make the FDI policy user-friendly by consolidating all prior regulations and guidelines into one comprehensive document. This would enhance clarity and predictability of our FDI policy to foreign investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial Stability and Development Council\n",
      "\n",
      "37.        The financial crisis of 2008-09 has fundamentally changed the structure of banking and financial markets the world over. With a view to strengthen and institutionalise the mechanism for maintaining financial stability, Government has decided to setup an apex-level Financial Stability and Development Council. Without prejudice to the autonomy of regulators, this Council would monitor macro prudential supervision of the economy, including the functioning of large financial conglomerates, and address inter-regulatory coordination issues. It will also focus on financial literacy and financial inclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banking Licences\n",
      "\n",
      "38.        The Indian banking system has emerged unscathed from the crisis. We need to ensure that the banking system grows in size and sophistication to meet the needs of a modern economy. Besides, there is a need to extend the geographic coverage of banks and improve access to banking services. In this context, I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that the RBI is considering giving some additional banking licenses to private sector players. Non Banking Financial Companies could also be considered, if they meet the RBI's eligibility criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Public Sector Bank Capitalisation\n",
      "\n",
      "39.        During 2008-09, the Government infused Rs.1900 crore as Tier-I capital in four public sector banks to maintain a comfortable level of Capital to Risk Weighted Asset Ratio. An additional sum of Rs.1200 crore is being infused now. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide a sum of Rs.16,500 crore to ensure that the Public Sector Banks are able to attain a minimum 8 per cent Tier-I capital by March 31, 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recapitalisation of Regional Rural Banks\n",
      "\n",
      "40.        Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) play an important role in providing credit to rural economy. The capital of these banks is shared by the Central Government, sponsor banks and State Governments. The banks were last capitalised in\n",
      "2006-07. I propose to provide further capital to strengthen the RRBs so that they have adequate capital base to support increased lending to the rural economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corporate Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "41.        Improvement in corporate governance and regulation is an important part of the overall investment environment in the country. Government has introduced the Companies Bill, 2009 in the Parliament, which will replace the existing Companies Act, 1956. The proposed new bill will address issues related to regulation in corporate sector in the context of the changing business environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exports\n",
      "\n",
      "42.        Government has provided interest subvention of 2 per cent on pre-shipment export credit up to March 31, 2010 for exports in certain sectors. I propose to extend the interest subvention of 2 per cent for one more year for exports covering handicrafts, carpets, handlooms and small and medium enterprises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Special Economic Zones (SEZs)\n",
      "\n",
      "43.        The SEZs have attracted significant flows of domestic and foreign investments. In first three quarters of 2009-10 exports from SEZs recorded a growth of 127 per cent over the corresponding period last year. Government is committed to ensuring continued growth of SEZs to draw investments and boost exports and employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agriculture Growth\n",
      "\n",
      "44.        The agriculture sector occupies centre-stage in our resolve to promote inclusive growth, enhance rural incomes and sustain food security. To spur the growth in this sector, the Government intends to follow a four-pronged strategy covering (a) agricultural production; (b) reduction in wastage of produce;\n",
      "(c) credit support to farmers; and (d) a thrust to the food processing sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "45.        The first element of the strategy is to extend the green revolution to the eastern region of the country comprising Bihar, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Eastern UP, West Bengal and Orissa, with the active involvement of Gram Sabhas and the farming families. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide Rs.400 crore for this initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "46.        In the 60th year of the Republic, it is proposed to organise 60,000 \"pulses and oil seed villages\" in rain-fed areas during 2010-11 and provide an integrated intervention for water harvesting, watershed management and soil health, to enhance the productivity of the dry land farming areas.  I propose to provide Rs.300 crore for this purpose. This initiative will be an integral part of the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.\n",
      "\n",
      "47.        The gains already made in the green revolution areas have to be sustained through conservation farming, which involves concurrent attention to soil health, water conservation and preservation of biodiversity.  I propose an allocation of Rs.200 crore for launching this climate resilient agriculture initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "48.        The second element of the strategy relates to reduction of significant wastages in storage as well as in the operations of the existing food supply chains in the country. This needs to be addressed. As the Prime Minister has said recently, \"We need greater competition and therefore need to take a firm view on opening up of the retail trade.\"  It will help in bringing down the considerable difference between the farm gate prices, wholesale prices and retail prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "49.        There is wastage of grain procured for buffer stocks and public distribution system due to acute shortage of storage capacity in the Food Corporation of India. This deficit in the storage capacity is met through an ongoing scheme for private sector participation where the FCI has been hiring godowns from private parties for a guaranteed period of 5 years. This period is now being extended to 7 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "50.        The third element of the strategy relates to improving the availability of credit to farmers.   I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that banks have been consistently meeting the targets set for agriculture credit flow in the past few years. For the year 2010-11, the target has been raised to Rs.3,75,000 crore from Rs.3,25,000 crore in the current year.\n",
      "\n",
      "51.        The Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme for Farmers was a major initiative of the UPA Government.

      "            I now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2010-11.\n",
      "\n",
      "112.      The Gross Tax Receipts are estimated at Rs.7,46,651 crore. The Non Tax Revenue Receipts are estimated at Rs.1,48,118 crore. The net tax revenue to the Centre as well as the expenditure provisions in 2010-11 have been estimated with reference to the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "113.      The total expenditure proposed in the Budget Estimates for 2010-11 is Rs.11,08,749 crore, which is an increase of 8.6 per cent over the total expenditure in BE 2009-10.  The Plan and Non Plan expenditures in BE 2010-11 are estimated at Rs.3,73,092 crore and Rs.7,35,657 crore, respectively. While there is a 15 per cent increase in Plan expenditure, the increase in Non Plan expenditure is only 6 per cent over the BE of previous year.  With this level of Plan expenditure, I am confident that the total Plan expenditure would be very close to 100 per cent of the expenditure envisaged in the Eleventh Five Year Plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "114.      Honourable Members will agree that fiscal policy has to be guided by the required framework for fiscal prudence. In the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement presented along with Budget 2009-10, I had laid down a road map for fiscal deficit. I am happy to report that in keeping with my commitment, I have been able to present the Budget for 2010-11 with a fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent. In the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement being presented to the House today, along with other Budget documents, the rolling targets for fiscal deficit are pegged at 4.8 per cent and 4.1 per cent for 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively. These projections improve upon the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "115.      While presenting the Budget for 2009-10, I had expressed my concern about the high level of fiscal deficit.  I had also stated that the Government will address this issue in right earnest to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation at the earliest.  I am happy to report that against a fiscal deficit of 7.8 per cent in 2008-09, inclusive of oil and fertiliser bonds, the comparable fiscal deficit is 6.9 per cent as per the Revised Estimates for 2009-10.  Both these deficit figures are based on the revised GDP numbers published by the Central Statistical Organisation and include what were earlier referred to as below the line items. This marks an improvement of about one per cent in fiscal deficit during the current year.  I have made a conscious effort to avoid issuing bonds to oil and fertiliser companies.  I would like to continue with this practice of extending Government subsidy in cash, thereby bringing all subsidy related liabilities into our fiscal accounting.\n",
      "\n",
      "116.     The fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2010-11 works out to Rs.3,81,408 crore.  Taking into account the various other financing items for fiscal deficit, the actual net market borrowing of the Government in 2010-11 would be of the order of Rs.3,45,010 crore.  There will be enough space to meet the credit needs of the private sector.  The Government will plan the borrowing programme in consultation with the RBI.\n",

      "Madam Speaker,\n",
      "\n",
      "            I shall now present my tax proposals.\n",
      "\n",
      "117.     While formulating them, I have been guided by the principles of sound tax administration as embodied in the following words of Kautilya:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thus, a wise Collector General shall conduct the work of revenue collection.... in a manner that production and consumption should not be injuriously affected.... financial prosperity depends on public prosperity, abundance of harvest and prosperity of commerce among other things.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "118.     I had stated last year that tax reform is a process and not an event.  The process I had outlined in the area of direct taxes was to release a draft Direct Taxes Code along with a Discussion Paper.   In the area of indirect taxes, the reform initiative was the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax. I have presented the developments in both reform initiatives in Part 'A' of my Speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "119.     We have continued on the path of computerisation in core areas of service delivery in the administration of direct taxes.  This will reduce the physical interface between taxpayers and tax administration and speed up procedures and processes. The Centralised Processing Centre at Bengaluru is now fully functional and is processing around 20,000 returns daily. This initiative will be taken forward by setting up two more Centres during the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "120.     As a part of Government's initiative to move towards citizen centric governance, the income tax department has introduced \"Sevottam\", a pilot project at Pune, Kochi and Chandigarh through Aayakar Seva Kendras.  These provide a single window system for registration of all applications including those for redressal of grievances as well as paper returns. This year the scheme will be extended to four more cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "121.     To achieve the roll-out of GST by April 2011, the indirect tax administrations at the Centre and the States need to revamp their internal work processes based on the use of Information Technology. I am happy to inform Honorable Members that project ACES - Automation of Central Excise & Service Tax, has already been rolled out throughout the country this year. This will impart greater transparency in tax administration and improve the delivery of taxpayer services. Similarly, a Mission Mode Project for computerisation of Commercial Taxes in States has been approved recently. With an outlay of Rs.1133 crore of which the Centre's share is Rs.800 crore, the project will lay the foundation for the launch of GST.\n",
      "\n",
      "122.     I mentioned last year, that the income tax return forms should be simple and user friendly. The income tax department is now ready to notify SARAL-II  form for individual salaried taxpayers for the coming assessment year. This form will enable individuals to enter relevant details in a simple format in only two pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "123.     To expeditiously resolve disputes with taxpayers I propose to expand the scope of cases which may be admitted by the Settlement Commission to include proceedings related to search and seizure cases pending for assessment. I also propose to expand the scope of Settlement Commission in respect of Central Excise and Customs so that certain categories of cases that hitherto fell outside its jurisdiction may be admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "124.     Last year, amendments to the statute enabled Government to enter into tax treaties with specified territories besides sovereign states. We have commenced bi-lateral discussions to enhance the exchange of bank related and other information to effectively track tax evasion and identify undisclosed assets of resident Indians lying abroad. \n",

      "Direct Taxes\n",
      "\n",
      "            I shall now deal with direct taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "125.     Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by enhancing the exemption limit for all taxpayers and withdrawing the surcharge on personal income tax. Taxpayers have responded positively to these concessions by contributing a higher level of taxes.  There is a persuasive case for further relief by broadening the current tax slabs which I propose as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "            Income upto Rs.1.6 lakh                                                     Nil\n",
      "\n",
      "            Income above Rs.1.6 lakh and upto Rs.5 lakh                     10 per cent\n",
      "\n",
      "            Income above Rs.5 lakh and upto Rs.8 lakh                        20 per cent\n",
      "\n",
      "            Income above Rs.8 lakh                                                      30 per cent\n",
      "\n",
      "126.     The proposed broadening of tax slabs will provide substantial relief to a large number of taxpayers.\n",
      "\n",
      "127.     To promote savings as well as to ensure their utilisation for the thrust area of infrastructure, I propose to allow a deduction of an additional amount of Rs.20,000 for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds as notified by the Central Government.  This would be over and above the existing limit of Rs.1 lakh on tax savings.  I am sure that these reliefs will put more money in the hands of individual taxpayers for both consumption as well as saving.\n",
      "\n",
      "128.     Besides contributions to health insurance schemes which is currently allowed as a deduction under the Income-tax Act, I propose to allow contributions to the Central Government Health Scheme also as a deduction under the same provision. \n",
      "\n",
      "129.     Taking forward my initiative of phasing out surcharge, I propose to reduce the current surcharge of 10 per cent on domestic companies to 7.5 per cent.  At the same time, I propose to increase the rate of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) from the current rate of 15 per cent to 18 per cent of book profits. This will further promote inter-se equity among corporate taxpayers.\n",
      "\n",
      "130.     The President, in her address to the Parliament in June 2009, had declared this decade as the Decade of Innovation. Last year, I extended the scope of weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house research and development (R&D) to all manufacturing businesses except for a small negative list.  To further encourage R&D across all sectors of the economy, I now propose to enhance the weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house R&D from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. I also propose to enhance the weighted deduction on payments made to National Laboratories, research associations, colleges, universities and other institutions, for scientific research from 125 per cent to 175 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "131.     Currently, any payment made to an approved scientific research association is eligible for weighted deduction. The income of the approved scientific research association is exempt from tax. I propose that payments made to approved associations engaged in research in social sciences or statistical research would be allowed a weighted deduction of 125 per cent. The income of such approved research associations shall be exempt from tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "132.     In my Budget Speech last year, I stated that profit linked deductions are inherently inefficient and liable to misuse. To incentivise businesses in priority sectors, I introduced investment linked deduction as an alternative to profit linked deduction.  To give a boost to investment in the tourism sector which has high employment potential, I propose to extend the benefit of investment linked deduction under the Act to new hotels of two-star category and above anywhere in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "133.     To provide one time interim relief to the housing and real estate sector which was impacted by the global recession, I propose to allow pending projects to be completed within a period of five years instead of four years for claiming a deduction on their profits. I also propose to relax the norms for built-up area of shops and other commercial establishments in housing projects to enable basic facilities for their residents.\n",
      "\n",
      "134.     All businesses with a turnover exceeding Rs.40 lakh are currently required to have their accounts audited.  A similar provision also applies to all professions whose receipts exceed Rs.10 lakh.  I, as Finance Minister, had introduced these limits in my budget of 1984.  It is high time to reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers.  I, therefore, propose to enhance these limits to Rs.60 lakh in the case of businesses and Rs.15 lakh in the case of professions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "135.     To facilitate the business operations of small taxpayers, I had extended the scope of presumptive taxation to all small businesses with a turnover of up to Rs.40 lakh.   To further reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers, I now propose to enhance this limit to Rs.60 lakh. \n",
      "\n",
      "136.     The threshold limits of payments below which tax is not deductible at source have remained unchanged for a long time.  I propose to rationalise these thresholds. \n",
      "\n",
      "137.     Relaxing the current provisions on disallowance of expenditure, I propose to allow deduction of such expenditure, if tax has been deducted at any time during the financial year and paid before the due date of filing the return. This will allow most deductors additional time up to September of the next financial year.  At the same time, I propose to increase the interest charged on tax deducted but not deposited by the specified date, from 12 per cent to 18 per cent per annum. \n",
      "\n",
      "138.     Last year, I had provided for the taxation of the newly introduced Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) on the same lines as exists for a general partnership firm. To facilitate the conversion of small companies into LLPs, I propose that this will not be subject to capital gains tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "139.     Under the current provisions of the Act, \"the advancement of any other object of general public utility\" cannot be considered as \"charitable purpose\" if it involves  carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business. I have received representations from many organisations seeking some relaxation in this restriction. I propose that this restriction would not be applicable if the receipts from such activities do not exceed Rs.10 lakh in the year. \n",
      "\n",
      "140.     My proposals on direct taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs.26,000 crore for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indirect Taxes\n",
      "\n",
      "141.     The major objectives that have guided me in the formulation of my proposals on indirect taxes are the need to achieve some degree of fiscal consolidation without impairing the recovery process and moving forward on the road to GST.\n",
      "\n",
      "142.     Unlike the time I presented the last Budget, symptoms of economic recovery are more widespread and clear-cut now. The three fiscal stimulus packages that the Government introduced in quick succession have helped the process of recovery significantly. The improvement in our economic performance encourages a course of fiscal correction even as the global situation warrants caution. Therefore, I propose to partially roll back the rate reduction in Central Excise duties and enhance the standard rate on all non-petroleum products from 8 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem. The specific rates of duty applicable to portland cement and cement clinker are also being adjusted upwards proportionately. Similarly, the ad valorem component of excise duty on large cars, multi-utility vehicles and sports-utility vehicles which was reduced as part of the first stimulus package, is being increased by 2 percentage points to 22 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "143.     In the wake of spiralling petroleum prices, Government provided full exemption from basic customs duty to crude petroleum and proportionately reduced the basic duty on refined petroleum products in June, 2008. Compared to the international price of the Indian crude basket of US$ 112 per barrel at that time, the prices are much softer at present. In view of the pressing need to move back to a fiscal consolidation path, I propose to restore the basic duty of 5 per cent on crude petroleum; 7.5 per cent on diesel and petrol and 10 per cent on other refined products. I also propose to enhance the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by Re.1 per litre each.\n",
      "\n",
      "144.     Since I quit smoking many years ago, I would urge others to also follow suit, as smoking is injurious to health. To this end, I am making some structural changes in the excise duty on cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos coupled with some increase in rates. I also propose to enhance excise duty on all non-smoking tobacco such as scented tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco etc. In addition, I propose to introduce a compounded levy scheme for chewing tobacco and branded unmanufactured tobacco based on the capacity of pouch packing machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "145.     Let me now turn to some much-needed incentives in thrust areas for sustainable growth and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agriculture & Related Sectors\n",
      "\n",
      "146.     In supporting the strategy outlined for development of agriculture earlier in my speech, I propose to address a few key areas that call for focused attention. These are:\n",
      "\n",
      "(i)       A strong supply chain for perishable farm produce to reach consumption and processing centres promptly;\n",
      "\n",
      "(ii)      Infrastructure and technology to convert such produce into value-added products; and\n",
      "\n",
      "(iii)     Infusion of technology to augment agricultural production.\n",
      "\n",
      "147.     Similar attention needs to be paid to related sectors such as apiary, horticulture, dairy, poultry, meat, marine and aquaculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "148.     For achieving these objectives, I propose to provide:\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         project import status with a concessional import duty of 5 per cent for the setting up of mechanised handling systems and pallet racking systems in 'mandis' or warehouses for food grains and sugar as well as full exemption from service tax for the installation and commissioning of such equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         project import status at a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent with full exemption from service tax to the initial setting up and expansion of\n",
      "\n",
      "Â»      Cold storage, cold room including farm pre-coolers for preservation or storage of agriculture and related sectors  produce ; and\n",
      "\n",
      "Â»      Processing units for such produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢        full exemption from customs duty to refrigeration units required for the manufacture of refrigerated vans or trucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "149.     I also propose to provide:\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         concessional customs duty of 5 per cent to specified agricultural machinery not manufactured in India;\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         central excise exemption to specified equipment for preservation, storage and processing of agriculture and related sectors and exemption from service tax to the storage and warehousing of their produce; and\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         full exemption from excise duty to trailers and semi-trailers used in agriculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "150.     Concessional import duty was provided to specified machinery for use in the plantation sector in the year 2003. This exemption is to lapse in July 2010.  The modernization of this labour-intensive sector is yet to reach the expected level. I propose therefore, to extend it up to March 31, 2011 along with a CVD exemption. I hope this will provide sufficient time for the sector to achieve the desired objective.\n",
      "\n",
      "151.     One of the prerequisites for agricultural productivity is access to good quality and disease-resistant seeds. I propose to exempt the testing and certification of agricultural seeds from service tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "152.     I also propose to exempt the transportation by road of cereals and pulses from service tax. Their transportation by rail would remain exempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "153.     I propose two measures under the Central Excise law to ease the cash flow position for small-scale manufacturers hard hit by the economic slowdown. First, they would be permitted to take full credit of Central Excise duty paid on capital goods in a single instalment in the year of their receipt. Secondly, they would be permitted to pay Central Excise duty on a quarterly, rather than monthly basis. These measures that come into effect on the April 1, 2010 should provide them considerable relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Environment\n",
      "\n",
      "154.     Harnessing renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels is now recognised as a credible strategy for combating global warming and climate change. To build the corpus of the National Clean Energy Fund announced earlier, I propose to levy a clean energy cess on coal produced in India at a nominal rate of Rs.50 per tonne. This cess will also apply to imported coal.\n",
      "\n",
      "155.     In pursuance of Government's resolve to implement the National Solar Mission, I propose to provide a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent to machinery, instruments, equipment and appliances etc. required for the initial setting up of photovoltaic and solar thermal power generating units. I also propose to exempt them from Central Excise duty. Similarly, ground source heat pumps used to tap geo-thermal energy would be exempt from basic customs duty and special additional duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "156.     Wind energy has shown promising growth in the country in recent years. As a measure of further relief, I propose to exempt a few more specified inputs required for the manufacture of rotor blades for wind energy generators from Central Excise duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "157.     LED lights are staging a debut as a highly energy-efficient source of lighting for streets, homes and offices. Central Excise duty on these is being reduced from 8 per cent to 4 per cent at par with Compact Fluorescent Lamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "158.     Full exemption from Central Excise duty was provided to electric cars and vehicles that offer an eco-friendly alternative to petrol or diesel vehicles. The manufacturers of such vehicles have expressed difficulty in neutralising the duty paid on their inputs and components. I propose to remedy this by imposing a nominal duty of 4 per cent on such vehicles. I also propose to exempt some critical parts or sub-assemblies of such vehicles from basic customs duty and special additional duty subject to actual user condition. These parts would also enjoy a concessional CVD of 4 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "159.     The humble cycle rickshaw is now being acclaimed as an environment-friendly means of transport. CSIR has developed an innovative product called 'soleckshaw' to replace manually-operated rickshaws. It runs on batteries which are charged by solar power. I propose to provide a concessional excise duty of 4 per cent to this product. Its key parts and components are also being exempted from customs duty. \n",
      "\n",
      "160.     To encourage the use of bio-degradable materials, I propose to exempt the import of compostable polymer from basic customs duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infrastructure\n",
      "\n",
      "161.     Strengthening the public transport system is another means of reducing dependence on fossil fuels. I propose to grant project import status to 'Monorail projects for urban transport' at a concessional basic duty of 5 per cent.          \n",
      "\n",
      "162.     Full exemption from import duty is available to specified machinery for road construction projects on the condition that the machinery shall not be sold or disposed of for a minimum period of five years. In view of representations that this leads to idling of machinery, I propose to allow resale of such machinery on payment of import duty at depreciated value. It is also being clarified that the importer is free to relocate such machinery to other eligible road construction projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "163.     With the subscriber base growing at 14 million per month, India is one of the fastest growing markets for mobile phone connections in the world. Domestic production of mobile phones is now picking up in view of exemptions from basic, CVD and special additional duties granted to their parts, components and accessories. To encourage the domestic manufacture of accessories, these exemptions are now being extended to parts of battery chargers and hands-free headphones. Also, the validity of the exemption from special additional duty is being extended till March 31, 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medical Sector\n",
      "\n",
      "164.     Medical equipment, instruments and appliances are subjected to a very complex import duty regime based on several long lists that describe individual items. Multiple rates coupled with descriptions not aligned with tariff lines, result in disputes and at times prevent state-of-art equipment from getting the benefit of exemption. I propose to prescribe a uniform, concessional basic duty of 5 per cent, CVD of 4 per cent with full exemption from special additional duty on all medical equipment. A concessional basic duty of 5 per cent is being prescribed on parts and accessories for the manufacture of such equipment while they would be exempt from CVD and special additional duty. Full exemption currently available to medical equipment and devices such as assistive devices, rehabilitation aids etc. is being retained. The concession available to Government hospitals or hospitals set up under a statute is also being retained.\n",
      "\n",
      "165.     The manufacturers of orthopaedic implants have represented that their inputs attract a higher rate of duty than the finished product. I propose to exempt specified inputs for the manufacture of such implants from import duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infotainment\n",
      "\n",
      "166.     India is a nation of movie-goers. The film industry has been experiencing difficulties in importing digital masters of films for duplication or distribution loaded on electronic medium vis-a-vis  those imported on cinematographic film, owing to a differential customs duty structure. I propose to rationalise this by charging customs duty only on the value of the carrier medium. The same dispensation would apply to music and gaming software imported for duplication. In keeping with the tradition of Indian cinema, however, I shall provide a surprise ending. In all such cases the value representing the transfer of intellectual rights would be subjected to service tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "167.     Cable transmission of infotainment is undergoing a transformation with the adoption of digital technology. The multi-service operators need to invest in \"Digital Head End\" equipment. To enable this, I propose to provide project import status at a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent with full exemption from special additional duty to the initial setting up of such projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Precious Metals\n",
      "\n",
      "168.     The prices of precious metals continue to rise. Since the customs duty is levied on these at specific rates, I propose to index the rates as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         On gold and platinum from Rs.200 per 10 grams to Rs.300 per 10 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢        On silver from Rs.1,000 per kg to Rs.1,500 per kg.\n",
      "\n",
      "169.     Gems and jewellery is a traditional item in our export basket. Rhodium - a precious metal used for polishing jewellery attracts a basic customs duty of 10 per cent. This is being reduced to 2 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "170.     To encourage domestic refining capacity for gold, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on gold ore and concentrates from 2 per cent ad valorem to a specific duty of Rs.140 per 10 grams of gold content with full exemption from special additional duty. Further, the excise duty on refined gold made from such ore or concentrate is being reduced from 8 per cent to a specific duty of Rs.280 per 10 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Proposals\n",
      "\n",
      "171.     Full exemption from import duty is available to specified inputs or raw materials required for the manufacture of sports goods which are assuming importance as an item of export. This is being expanded to cover a few more items.\n",
      "\n",
      "172.     In order to incentivise the domestic production of microwave ovens, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on one of its key components, namely magnetrons from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "173.     Presently, there is a value limit of Rs.1 lakh per annum on duty-free import of commercial samples as personal baggage. I propose to enhance this limit to Rs.3 lakh per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "174.     Industry has represented that the exemption from special additional duty of 4 per cent based on refunds leads to substantial blockage of funds.  To ease this difficulty, I propose to provide an outright exemption from special additional duty to goods imported in a pre-packaged form for retail sale. This would also cover mobile phones, watches and ready-made garments even when they are not imported in pre-packaged form. The refund-based exemption is also being retained for cases not covered by the new dispensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "175.     Toy balloons are a source of joy to millions of children. To bring a smile to their mothers' faces, I propose to fully exempt them from Central Excise duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "176.     Some of the other relief measures that I propose are as under:\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         Reduction in basic customs duty on long pepper from 70 per cent to 30 per cent;\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         Reduction in basic customs duty on asafoetida from 30 per cent to 20 per cent;\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         Reduction in central excise duty on replaceable kits for household type water filters other than those based on RO technology to 4 per cent;\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         Reduction in central excise duty on corrugated boxes and cartons from 8 per cent to 4 per cent;\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         Reduction in central excise duty on latex rubber thread from 8 per cent to 4 per cent; and\n",
      "\n",
      "â€¢         Reduction in excise duty on goods covered under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act from 16 per cent to 10 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "177.     My proposals relating to customs and central excise are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs.43,500 crore for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service Tax\n",
      "\n",
      "178.     The service sector contributes nearly 60 per cent of the GDP.   The service tax to GDP ratio however, is only around 1 per cent. This sector thus, has significant potential to augment revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "179.     To bridge this gap, I had the option to raise the rate of service tax to 12 per cent as it was before I introduced the third stimulus package.  I am not resorting to this option to maintain the growth momentum and also to bring about a convergence in the rates of tax on goods and services.  I, therefore, propose to retain the rate of tax on services at 10 per cent to pave the way forward for GST.\n",
      "\n",
      "180.     I had another option - to bring all services under service tax. I am not opting for this either at this stage. I propose, however, to bring certain services, hitherto untaxed, within the purview of the service tax levy. These are being notified separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "181.     I am also proposing certain legislative changes to plug revenue leakages, to remove distortions and to clarify certain doubts that have arisen over a period of time. I do not want to waste the precious time of the House elaborating the details, as they are available in the Finance Bill and other Budget documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "182.     Export of services, especially in the area of Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing, generates substantial employment and brings in foreign exchange. I propose to ease the process of refund of accumulated credit to exporters of services by making necessary changes in the definition of export of services and procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "183.     Accredited news agencies which provide news feed online attract service tax. Acknowledging the yeoman services of such news agencies in disseminating news, I propose to exempt such news agencies that meet certain criteria, from service tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "184.     My proposals relating to service tax are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs.3,000 crore for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "185.     Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs, central excise and service tax will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.\n",
      "\n",
      "186.     My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs.26,000 crore for the year. Proposals relating to Indirect Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs.46,500 crore for the year. Taking into account the concessions being given in my tax proposals and measures taken to mobilise additional resources, the net revenue gain is estimated to be Rs.20,500 crore for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "187.     We have emerged from the global slowdown faster than any other nation. I did not hesitate in exercising my judgement on the course of action last year and I have no hesitation in my mind now. Our actions today will determine our tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "188.     This Budget belongs to 'Aam Aadmi'.  It belongs to the farmer, the agriculturist, the entrepreneur and the investor. The opportunity is great. The time is right. I have placed my faith in the hands of the people who, I know, can be depended upon to rise to any occasion in national interest. I have placed my faith in the collective conscience of the nation that can be touched to scale undreamt of heights in the coming years.\n",
      "\n",
      "189.     Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Budget to the House.\n",

      "['Budget  2010-2011\\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech  of\\n\\nPranab Mukherjee\\n\\nMinister of Finance\\n\\n \\n\\nFebruary  26,  2010\\n\\n \\n\\nMadam Speaker,\\n\\n            I rise to present the Union Budget for 2010-11.\\n\\n            In 2009, when I presented the interim Budget in February and the regular Budget in July in this august House, the Indian economy was facing grave uncertainties. Growth had started decelerating and the business sentiment was weak. The economy\\'s capacity to sustain high growth was under serious threat from the widespread economic slowdown in the developed world.\\n\\n2.          It was not clear to us, as also to the policy makers in many other countries, how this crisis would eventually unfold. What would be its impact on the growth momentum of the Indian economy?  How soon will we be able to turnaround the fortunes of our economy? The short term global outlook was bleak and the consensus was that year 2009 would face the brunt of this crisis across the world.\\n\\n3.          At home, there was added uncertainty on account of the delayed and sub-normal south-west monsoon, which had undermined the kharif crop in the country.  There were concerns about production and prices of food items and its possible repercussions on the growth of rural demand.\\n\\n4.          Today, as I stand before you, I can say with confidence that we have weathered these crises well. Indian economy now is in a far better position than it was a year ago. That is not to say that the challenges today are any less than what they were nine months ago when UPA under the leadership of Mrs Sonia Gandhi was elected back to power and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh formed the Government for the second term.\\n\\n5.          The three challenges and the medium term perspective that I had outlined in my last Budget Speech remain relevant, even today. These would continue to engage the Indian policy-planners for the next few years.\\n\\n6.          The first challenge before us is to quickly revert to the high GDP growth path of 9 per cent and then find the means to cross the \\'double digit growth barrier\\'. This calls for imparting a fresh momentum to the impressive recovery in growth witnessed in the past few months. In this endeavour, I seek Lord Indra\\'s help to make the recovery more broad-based in the coming months.\\n\\n7.          Growth is only as important as what it enables us to do and be. Therefore, the second challenge is to harness economic growth to consolidate the recent gains in making development more inclusive. The thrust imparted to the development of infrastructure in rural areas has to be pursued to achieve the desired objectives within a fixed time frame.\\n\\n8.          We have to strengthen food security, improve education opportunities and provide health facilities at the level of households, both in rural and urban areas. These are issues that require significant resources, and we have to find those resources.\\n\\n9.          The third challenge relates to the weaknesses in government systems, structures and institutions at different levels of governance. Indeed, in the coming years, if there is one factor that can hold us back in realising our potential as a modern nation, it is the bottleneck of our public delivery mechanisms. There have been many initiatives in this regard, in different sectors, at different points of time. Some of them have been effective in reforming the way the Government works in those areas. But we have a long way to go before we can rest on this count.\\n\\n10.        The Union Budget cannot be a mere statement of Government accounts. It has to reflect the Government\\'s vision and signal the policies to come in future.\\n\\n11.        With development and economic reforms, the focus of economic activity has shifted towards the non-governmental actors, bringing into sharper focus the role of Government as an enabler.\\n\\n12.        An enabling Government does not try to deliver directly to the citizens everything that they need. Instead it creates an enabling ethos so that individual enterprise and creativity can flourish. Government concentrates on supporting and delivering services to the disadvantaged sections of the society.\\n\\n13.        It is this broad conceptualisation of the Budget that informs my speech today. I would now begin by presenting a brief overview of the economy.\\n\\nOverview of the Economy\\n\\n14.        Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey, which gives a detailed analysis of the economic situation of the country over the past twelve months.  I intend to highlight only a few salient features that form the backdrop of this Budget.\\n\\n15.        The fiscal year 2009-10 was a challenging year for the Indian economy. The significant deceleration in the second half of 2008-09, brought the real GDP growth down to 6.7 per cent, from an average of over 9 per cent in the preceding three years. We were among the first few countries in the world to implement a broad-based counter-cyclic policy package to respond to the negative fallout of the global slowdown. It included a substantial fiscal expansion along with liberal monetary policy support.\\n\\n16.        The effectiveness of these policy measures became evident with fast paced recovery. The economy stabilised in the first quarter of 2009-10 itself, when it clocked a GDP growth of 6.1 per cent, as against 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. It registered a strong rebound in the second quarter, when the growth rate rose to 7.9 per cent. With the Advance Estimates placing the likely growth for 2009-10 at 7.2 per cent, we are indeed vindicated in our policy stand. The final figure may well turn out to be higher when the third and fourth quarter GDP estimates for 2009-10 become available.\\n\\n17.        This recovery is very encouraging for it has come about despite a negative growth in the agriculture sector.  More importantly, it is the result of a renewed momentum in the manufacturing sector and marks the rise of this sector as the growth driver of the economy. The growth rate in manufacturing in December 2009 was 18.5 per centâ€” the highest in the past two decades. There are also signs of a turnaround in the merchandise exports with a positive growth in November and December 2009 after a decline of about twelve successive months. Export figures for January are also encouraging.  Significant private investment can now be expected to provide the engine for sustaining a growth of 9 per cent per annum. With some luck, I hope to breach the 10 per cent mark in not-too-distant a future.\\n\\n18.        A major concern during the second half of 2009-10 has been the emergence of double digit food inflation. There was a momentum in food prices since the flare-up of global commodity prices preceding the financial crisis in 2008, but it was expected that the agriculture season beginning June 2009 would help in moderating the food inflation. However, the erratic monsoons and drought like conditions in large parts of the country reinforced the supply side bottlenecks in some of the essential commodities. This set in motion inflationary expectations. Since December 2009, there have been indications of these high food prices, together with the gradual hardening of the fuel product prices, getting transmitted to other non-food items as well. The inflation data for January seems to have confirmed this trend.\\n\\n19.        Government is acutely conscious of this situation and has set in motion steps, in consultation with the State Chief Ministers, which should bring down the inflation in the next few months and ensure that there is better management of food security in the country.\\n\\nCONSOLIDATING  GROWTH\\n\\n20.       Managing a complex economy is a difficult task, more so when it is a growing economy in a globalised world. And yet, choices have to be made and they have to be well-timed.\\n\\n21.        After successfully managing the effects of the global slowdown, we need to strengthen the domestic macroeconomic environment to help consolidate the rebound in growth and sustain it over the medium term. We need to review the stimulus imparted to the economy and move towards the preferred path of fiscal consolidation that facilitated the remarkable growth in the pre-crisis five year period.  We need to make growth more broad-based and ensure that supply-demand imbalances are better managed.\\n\\nFiscal Consolidation\\n\\n22.        The success of the fiscal stimulus in supporting domestic demand could be traced to its composition. The approach of the Government was to increase the disposable income in the hands of the people by effecting reductions in indirect taxes and by expanding public expenditure on programmes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and rural infrastructure. Now that the recovery has taken root, there is a need to review public spending, mobilise resources and gear them towards building the productivity of the economy.\\n\\n23.        In shaping the fiscal policy for 2010-11, I have acted on the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission. It has recommended a calibrated exit strategy from the expansionary fiscal stance of last two years. The Commission has recommended a capping of the combined debt of the Centre and the States at 68 per cent of the GDP to be achieved by 2014-15.\\n\\n24.        As a part of the fiscal consolidation process, it would be for the first time that the Government would target an explicit reduction in its domestic public debt-GDP ratio. I intend to bring out, within six months, a status paper giving a detailed analysis of the situation and a road map for curtailing the overall public debt. This would be followed by an annual report on the subject.\\n\\nTax reforms\\n\\n25.        I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that the process for building a simple tax system with minimum exemptions and low rates designed to promote voluntary compliance, is now nearing completion. On the Direct Tax Code the wide-ranging discussions with stakeholders have been concluded.  I am confident that the Government will be in a position to implement the Direct Tax Code from April 1, 2011.\\n\\n26.        On Goods and Services Tax, we have been focusing on generating a wide consensus on its design. In November, 2009 the Empowered Committee of the State Finance Ministers placed the first discussion paper on GST in the public domain. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has also made a number of significant recommendations relating to GST, which will contribute to the ongoing discussions. We are actively engaged with the Empowered Committee to finalise the structure of GST as well as the modalities of its expeditious implementation. It will be my earnest endeavour to introduce GST along with the DTC in April, 2011.\\n\\nPeople\\'s ownership of PSUs\\n\\n27.        While presenting the Budget for 2009-10, I invited people to participate in Government\\'s disinvestment programme to share in the wealth and prosperity of the Central Public Sector Undertakings.\\n\\n28.        Since then, ownership has been broad based in Oil India Limited, NHPC, NTPC and Rural Electrification Corporation while the process is on for National Mineral Development Corporation and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam. The Government will raise about Rs.25,000 crore during the current year. Through this process, I propose to raise a higher amount during the year 2010-11. The proceeds will be utilised to meet the capital expenditure requirements of social sector schemes for creating new assets.\\n\\n29.        Listing of Central Public Sector Undertakings improves corporate governance, besides unlocking the value for all stakeholdersâ€”the government, the company and the shareholders. Market capitalization of five companies which have been listed since October, 2004 has increased by 3.8 times from the book value of Rs.78,841 crore to Rs.2,98,929 crore.\\n\\n30.        The effective management of public expenditure by bringing it in line with the Government\\'s objectives is a part of the fiscal consolidation process. This calls for proper targeting of subsidies and expenditure adjustment.\\n\\nFertiliser subsidy\\n\\n31.        I had announced the intent of the Government for the fertiliser sector in my Budget Speech of 2009. A Nutrient Based Subsidy policy for the fertiliser sector has since been approved by the Government and will become effective from April 1, 2010. This policy is expected to promote balanced fertilization through new fortified products and focus on extension services by the fertiliser industry. This will lead to an increase in agricultural productivity and consequently better returns for the farmers. Over time, the policy is expected to reduce volatility in the demand for fertiliser subsidy in addition to containing the subsidy bill. Government will ensure that nutrient based fertiliser prices for transition year 2010-11, will remain around MRPs currently prevailing. The new system will move towards direct transfer of subsidies to the farmers.\\n\\nPetroleum and Diesel pricing policy\\n\\n32.        In the last Budget, the constitution of an Expert Group, to advise the Government on a viable and sustainable system of pricing of petroleum products, was announced.  The Group headed by Shri Kirit Parikh has submitted its recommendations to the Government.  Decision on these recommendations will be taken by my colleague, the Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, in due course.\\n\\n33.        I am very happy to inform the Honourable Members that we have not only adhered to the fiscal roadmap that I had presented as a part of the Budget documents last year, but we have improved upon it. Except for meeting the liabilities of the year 2008-09, we have not issued oil or fertiliser bonds. I shall come to the numbers when I refer to the budget estimates a little later.\\n\\nImproving Investment Environment\\n\\nForeign Direct Investment\\n\\n34.        Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows during the year have been steady in spite of the decline in global capital flows. India received FDI equity inflows of US$ 20.9 billion during April-December, 2009 compared to US$ 21.1 billion during the same period last year.\\n\\n35.        Government has taken a number of steps to simplify the FDI regime to make it easily comprehensible to foreign investors. For the first time, both ownership and control have been recognised as central to the FDI policy, and methodology for calculation of indirect foreign investment in Indian companies has been clearly defined. A consistent policy on downstream investment has also been formulated. Another major initiative has been the complete liberalization of pricing and payment of technology transfer fee, trademark, brand name and royalty payments. These payments can now be made under the automatic route.\\n\\n36.        Government also intends to make the FDI policy user-friendly by consolidating all prior regulations and guidelines into one comprehensive document. This would enhance clarity and predictability of our FDI policy to foreign investors.\\n\\nFinancial Stability and Development Council\\n\\n37.        The financial crisis of 2008-09 has fundamentally changed the structure of banking and financial markets the world over. With a view to strengthen and institutionalise the mechanism for maintaining financial stability, Government has decided to setup an apex-level Financial Stability and Development Council. Without prejudice to the autonomy of regulators, this Council would monitor macro prudential supervision of the economy, including the functioning of large financial conglomerates, and address inter-regulatory coordination issues. It will also focus on financial literacy and financial inclusion.\\n\\nBanking Licences\\n\\n38.        The Indian banking system has emerged unscathed from the crisis. We need to ensure that the banking system grows in size and sophistication to meet the needs of a modern economy. Besides, there is a need to extend the geographic coverage of banks and improve access to banking services. In this context, I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that the RBI is considering giving some additional banking licenses to private sector players. Non Banking Financial Companies could also be considered, if they meet the RBI\\'s eligibility criteria.\\n\\nPublic Sector Bank Capitalisation\\n\\n39.        During 2008-09, the Government infused Rs.1900 crore as Tier-I capital in four public sector banks to maintain a comfortable level of Capital to Risk Weighted Asset Ratio. An additional sum of Rs.1200 crore is being infused now. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide a sum of Rs.16,500 crore to ensure that the Public Sector Banks are able to attain a minimum 8 per cent Tier-I capital by March 31, 2011.\\n\\nRecapitalisation of Regional Rural Banks\\n\\n40.        Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) play an important role in providing credit to rural economy. The capital of these banks is shared by the Central Government, sponsor banks and State Governments. The banks were last capitalised in\\n2006-07. I propose to provide further capital to strengthen the RRBs so that they have adequate capital base to support increased lending to the rural economy.\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\n\\n41.        Improvement in corporate governance and regulation is an important part of the overall investment environment in the country. Government has introduced the Companies Bill, 2009 in the Parliament, which will replace the existing Companies Act, 1956. The proposed new bill will address issues related to regulation in corporate sector in the context of the changing business environment.\\n\\nExports\\n\\n42.        Government has provided interest subvention of 2 per cent on pre-shipment export credit up to March 31, 2010 for exports in certain sectors. I propose to extend the interest subvention of 2 per cent for one more year for exports covering handicrafts, carpets, handlooms and small and medium enterprises.\\n\\nSpecial Economic Zones (SEZs)\\n\\n43.        The SEZs have attracted significant flows of domestic and foreign investments. In first three quarters of 2009-10 exports from SEZs recorded a growth of 127 per cent over the corresponding period last year. Government is committed to ensuring continued growth of SEZs to draw investments and boost exports and employment.\\n\\nAgriculture Growth\\n\\n44.        The agriculture sector occupies centre-stage in our resolve to promote inclusive growth, enhance rural incomes and sustain food security. To spur the growth in this sector, the Government intends to follow a four-pronged strategy covering (a) agricultural production; (b) reduction in wastage of produce;\\n(c) credit support to farmers; and (d) a thrust to the food processing sector.\\n\\n45.        The first element of the strategy is to extend the green revolution to the eastern region of the country comprising Bihar, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Eastern UP, West Bengal and Orissa, with the active involvement of Gram Sabhas and the farming families. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide Rs.400 crore for this initiative.\\n\\n46.        In the 60th year of the Republic, it is proposed to organise 60,000 \"pulses and oil seed villages\" in rain-fed areas during 2010-11 and provide an integrated intervention for water harvesting, watershed management and soil health, to enhance the productivity of the dry land farming areas.  I propose to provide Rs.300 crore for this purpose. This initiative will be an integral part of the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.\\n\\n47.        The gains already made in the green revolution areas have to be sustained through conservation farming, which involves concurrent attention to soil health, water conservation and preservation of biodiversity.  I propose an allocation of Rs.200 crore for launching this climate resilient agriculture initiative.\\n\\n48.        The second element of the strategy relates to reduction of significant wastages in storage as well as in the operations of the existing food supply chains in the country. This needs to be addressed. As the Prime Minister has said recently, \"We need greater competition and therefore need to take a firm view on opening up of the retail trade.\"  It will help in bringing down the considerable difference between the farm gate prices, wholesale prices and retail prices.\\n\\n49.        There is wastage of grain procured for buffer stocks and public distribution system due to acute shortage of storage capacity in the Food Corporation of India. This deficit in the storage capacity is met through an ongoing scheme for private sector participation where the FCI has been hiring godowns from private parties for a guaranteed period of 5 years. This period is now being extended to 7 years.\\n\\n50.        The third element of the strategy relates to improving the availability of credit to farmers.   I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that banks have been consistently meeting the targets set for agriculture credit flow in the past few years. For the year 2010-11, the target has been raised to Rs.3,75,000 crore from Rs.3,25,000 crore in the current year.\\n\\n51.        The Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme for Farmers was a major initiative of the UPA Government. In view of the recent drought in some States and the severe floods in some other parts of the country, I propose to extend by six months the period for repayment of the loan amount by farmers from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010.\\n\\n52.        In the last budget, I had provided an additional one per cent interest subvention as an incentive to those farmers who repay their short-term crop loans as per schedule. I propose to raise this subvention for timely repayment of crop loans from one per cent to two per cent for 2010-11. Thus, the effective rate of interest for such farmers will now be five per cent per annum. Necessary provision in the Budget has been made.\\n\\n53.       The fourth element of the strategy aims at lending a further impetus to the development of food processing sector by providing state-of-the art infrastructure.  In addition to the ten mega food park projects already being set up, the Government has decided to set up five more such parks.\\n\\n54.        As a part of the farm to market initiative, External Commercial Borrowings will henceforth be available for cold storage or cold room facility, including for farm level pre-cooling, for preservation or storage of agricultural and allied produce, marine products and meat. Changes in the definition of infrastructure under the ECB policy are being made.\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\n55.        Accelerated development of high quality physical infrastructure, such as roads, ports, airports and railways is essential to sustain economic growth. While addressing the policy gaps in this sector, I propose to maintain the thrust for upgrading infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. In the Budget for\\n2010-11, I have provided Rs.1,73,552 crore, which accounts for over 46 per cent of the total plan allocations, for infrastructure development in the country.\\n\\n56.        To make a visible impact in the road sector, Government has targeted construction of national highways (NHs) at the pace of 20 km per day.  To push the pace of implementation, changes have been made in the policy framework, especially in respect of projects being executed through public private partnerships (PPPs). For the year 2010-11, I propose to raise the allocation of road transport by over 13 per cent from Rs.17,520 crore to Rs.19,894 crore.\\n\\n57.        Honourable Members have already heard from the Railway Minister about the large investments required to modernise and expand the network. I have provided Rs.16,752 crore in the Budget for 2010-11 for Railways to lend her a helping hand. This is about Rs.950 crore more than last year, when a substantial increase was made in the budgetary support for Railways.\\n\\n58.        To complement the dedicated freight corridor, the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor project has been taken up for integrated regional development. Preparatory activities have been completed for creation of six industrial investment nodes with eco-friendly world class infrastructure.\\n\\nIndia Infrastructure Finance Company Limited\\n\\n59.        Government established the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) to provide long term financial assistance to infrastructure projects. Its disbursements are expected to touch Rs.9,000 crore by end March 2010 and reach around Rs.20,000 crore by March 2011. IIFCL has also been authorised to refinance bank lending to infrastructure projects. It has refinanced Rs.3,000 crore during the current year and is expected to more than double that amount in 2010-11. The take-out financing scheme announced in the last Budget is expected to initially provide finance for about Rs.25,000 crore in the next three years.\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\n60.        Government accords the highest priority to capacity addition in the power sector. The framework for induction of super critical technology in large capacity power plants of National Thermal Power Corporation is now in place.  The Mega Power Policy has been modified and is now consistent with the National Electricity Policy, 2005 and Tariff Policy, 2006. It will help in lowering the cost of generation and the cost of power purchased by distribution utilities. I have more than doubled the plan allocation for power sector from Rs.2,230 crore in 2009-10 to Rs.5,130 crore in 2010-11. This does not include allocations for RGGVY, which is a part of Bharat Nirman.\\n\\n61.        Coal is the mainstay of India\\'s energy sector and 75 per cent of the power generation is currently coal based. It is proposed to introduce a competitive bidding process for allocating coal blocks for captive mining to ensure greater transparency and increased participation in production from these blocks.\\n\\n62.        Government proposes to take steps to set up a \"Coal Regulatory Authority\" to create a level playing field in the coal sector. This would facilitate resolution of issues like economic pricing of coal and benchmarking of standards of performance. \\n\\n63.        The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission envisages establishing India as a global leader in solar energy.  An ambitious target of 20,000 MW of solar power by the year 2022 has been set under the mission. I propose to increase the plan outlay for the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy by 61 per cent from Rs.620 crore in 2009-10 to Rs.1,000 crore in 2010-11.\\n\\n64.        The Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir faces an extremely harsh climate and suffers from energy deficiency. To address this problem, it is proposed to set up solar, small hydro and micro power projects at a cost of about Rs.500 crore.\\n\\nEnvironment and Climate change\\n\\n65.        To ameliorate the negative environmental consequences and increased pollution levels associated with industrialisation and urbanisation, I propose to take a number of proactive steps in the Budget 2010-11.\\n\\nNational Clean Energy Fund (NCEF)\\n\\n66.        There are many areas of the country where pollution levels have reached alarming proportions. While we must ensure that the principle of \"polluter pays\" remains the basic guiding criteria for pollution management, we must also give a positive thrust to development of clean energy. I propose to establish a National Clean Energy Fund for funding research and innovative projects in clean energy technologies. I shall outline the mode of funding for this initiative in Part B of my speech.\\n\\nEffluent Treatment Plant, Tirupur\\n\\n67.       The textile cluster for knitwear in Tirupur in Tamil Nadu is a major contributor to the country\\'s hosiery exports. I propose to provide a one-time grant of Rs.200 crore to the Government of Tamil Nadu towards the cost of installation of a zero liquid discharge system at Tirupur to sustain this industry, which provides livelihood to lakhs of persons, without undermining the environment.\\n\\nSpecial Golden Jubilee Package for Goa\\n\\n68.        I propose to provide a sum of Rs.200 crore as a Special Golden Jubilee package for Goa to preserve the natural resources of the State by restoring Goa\\'s beaches which are prone to erosion, and increasing its green cover through sustainable forestry.\\n\\nNational Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA)\\n\\n69.        The \"Mission Clean Ganga 2020\" under the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) with the objective that no untreated municipal sewage or industrial effluent will be discharged into the national river has already been initiated. I propose to double the allocation for NGRBA in 2010-11 to Rs.500 crore.\\n\\n70.        I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that schemes on bank protection works along river Bhagirathi and river Ganga-Padma in parts of Murshidabad and Nadia district of West Bengal have been included in the Centrally Sponsored Flood Management Programme. I also propose to provide budgetary support for drainage scheme of Kaliaghai-Kapaleswari Baghai basin in the district of Purba and Paschim Midnapore, and Master Plan of Kandi sub-division in Murshidabad, West Bengal.\\n\\n71.        Recognising the need for developing an alternate port facility in West Bengal, it is proposed to develop a project at Sagar Island. Necessary funds will be provided in due course.\\n\\nINCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT\\n\\n72.        For the UPA Government, inclusive development is an act of faith. In the last five years, our Government has created entitlements backed by legal guarantees for an individual\\'s right to information and her right to work. This has been followed-up with the enactment of the right to education in 2009-10. As the next step, we are now ready with the draft Food Security Bill which will be placed in the public domain very soon. To fulfil these commitments the spending on social sector has been gradually increased to Rs.1,37,674 crore which now stands at 37 per cent of the total plan outlay in 2010-11.  Another 25 per cent of the plan allocations are devoted to the development of rural infrastructure. With growth and the opportunities that it generates, we hope to further strengthen the process of inclusive development.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\n73.        The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 creates a framework for legal entitlements for all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years to education of good quality, based on principles of equity and\\nnon-discrimination. In recent years, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has made significant contribution in improving enrolment and infrastructure for elementary education. About 98 per cent of habitations are now covered by primary schools. I propose to increase the plan allocation for school education from Rs.26,800 crore in 2009-10  to Rs.31,036 crore in 2010-11. In addition, States will have access to Rs.3,675 crore for elementary education under the Thirteenth Finance Commission grants for 2010-11.\\n\\nHealth\\n\\n74.        An Annual Health Survey to prepare the District Health Profile of all Districts shall be conducted in 2010-11. The findings of the Survey should be of immense benefit to major public health initiatives particularly the National Rural Health Mission, which has successfully addressed the gaps in the delivery of critical health services in rural areas.\\n\\n75.        I propose to increase the plan allocation for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,  from Rs.19,534 crore to Rs.22,300 crore for 2010-11.\\n\\nFinancial Inclusion\\n\\n76.        To reach the benefits of banking services to the \\'Aam Aadmi\\', the Reserve Bank of India had set up a High Level Committee on the Lead Bank Scheme. After careful assessment of the recommendations of this Committee, and in further consultation with the RBI, it has been decided to provide appropriate Banking facilities to habitations having population in excess of 2000 by March, 2012. It is also proposed to extend insurance and other services to the targeted beneficiaries. These services will be provided using the Business Correspondent and other models with appropriate technology back up. By this arrangement, it is proposed to cover 60,000 habitations.\\n\\nFinancial Inclusion Fund (FIF) and the Financial Inclusion Technology Fund\\n\\n77.        In 2007-08 the Government had set up a Financial Inclusion Fund and a Financial Inclusion Technology Fund in NABARD, to reach banking services to the unbanked areas. To give momentum to the pace of financial inclusion, I propose an augmentation of Rs.100 crore for each of these funds, which shall be contributed by Government of India, RBI and NABARD.\\n\\nRural Development\\n\\n78.        In the words of Mahatma Gandhi \"Just as the universe is contained in the self, so is India contained in the villages\". For UPA Government, development of rural infrastructure remains a high priority area. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide Rs.66,100 crore for Rural Development.\\n\\n79.        Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has completed four years of implementation during which it has been extended to all districts covering more than 4.5 crore households. The allocation for NREGA has been stepped up to Rs.40,100 crore in 2010-11. Bharat Nirman has made a substantial contribution to the upgradation of rural infrastructure through its various programmes. For the year 2010-11, I propose to allocate an amount of Rs.48,000 crore for these programmes.\\n\\n80.        Indira Awas Yojana is a popular rural housing scheme for weaker sections. Taking note of the increase in the cost of construction, I propose to raise the unit cost under this scheme to Rs.45,000 in the plain areas and to Rs.48,500 in the hilly areas. For the year 2010-11, the allocation for this scheme is being increased to Rs.10,000 crore.\\n\\n81.        As a part of the strategy to bridge the infrastructure gap in backward districts of the country, the Backward Region Grant Fund has proved to be an effective instrument. I propose to enhance the allocation to this fund by 26 per cent from Rs.5,800 crore in 2009-10 to Rs.7,300 crore in 2010-11. I have also provided an additional central assistance of Rs.1,200 crore for drought mitigation in the Bundelkhand region in the Budget.\\n\\nUrban Development and Housing\\n\\n82.        \"Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana\" designed to provide employment opportunities in urban areas, has been strengthened with focus on community participation, skill development and self employment support structures. For the year 2010-11, I propose to increase the allocation for urban development by more than 75 per cent from Rs.3,060 crore to Rs.5,400 crore.  In addition, the allocation for Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation is also being raised from Rs.850 crore to Rs.1,000 crore in 2010-11.\\n\\n83.        While presenting the Union Budget for the year 2009-10, I had announced a Scheme of one per cent interest subvention on housing loans up to Rs.10 lakhs where the cost of the house does not exceed Rs.20 lakhs. I propose to extend this Scheme up to March 31, 2011. Accordingly, I propose to provide a sum of Rs.700 crore for this Scheme for the year 2010-11.\\n\\n84.        The Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) for slum dwellers and urban poor was announced last year to extend support to States that are willing to provide property rights to slum dwellers. This scheme is now ready to take off. I propose to allocate Rs.1,270 crore for 2010-11 as compared to Rs.150 crore last year. This marks an increase of over 700 per cent. The Government\\'s efforts in the implementation of RAY would be to encourage the States to create a slum free India at the earliest.\\n\\nMicro, Small & Medium Enterprises\\n\\n85.        Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) contribute 8 per cent of the country\\'s GDP, 45 per cent of the manufactured output and 40 per cent of our exports. They provide employment to about 6 crore persons through 2.6 crore enterprises. To resolve a number of issues which affect the growth of this sector, Prime Minister constituted a High-Level Task Force which held detailed discussions with all stake holders and drew up an agenda for action. A High Level Council on Micro and Small Enterprises will monitor the implementation of the recommendations and the agenda for action. I propose to raise the allocation for this sector from Rs.1,794 crore to Rs.2,400 crore for the year 2010-11.\\n\\n86.        A loan agreement for US $ 150 million has been signed between the Government of India and the Asian Development Bank on 22nd December, 2009 for implementing the comprehensive Khadi Reforms Programme. This programme will cover 300 selected Khadi institutions.\\n\\nMicro Finance\\n\\n87.        The programme for linking Self Help Groups (SHGs) with the banking system has emerged as the major micro-finance initiative in the country. It was re-designated as the \\'Micro-Finance Development and Equity Fund\\' in 2005-06 with a corpus of Rs.200 crore. The fund corpus is being doubled to Rs.400 crore in 2010-11.\\n\\nUnorganised Sector\\n\\nNational Social Security Fund for unorganised sector workers\\n\\n88.        Recognising the need for providing social security to the workers in the unorganised sector, and as a follow up to the Unorganised Sector Workers Social Security Act, 2008, it has been decided to set up a National Social Security Fund for unorganised sector workers with an initial allocation of Rs.1,000 crore. This fund will support schemes for weavers, toddy tappers, rickshaw pullers, bidi workers etc.\\n\\n89.        The Government had launched Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana on October 1, 2007 to provide health insurance cover to below poverty line workers and their families. It became operational on April 1, 2008 and so far more than 1 crore smart cards have been issued under this scheme. In view of the success of the scheme, it is now proposed to extend its benefits to all such Mahatma Gandhi NREGA beneficiaries who have worked for more than 15 days during the preceding financial year.\\n\\n90.        To encourage the people from the unorganised sector to voluntarily save for their retirement and to lower the cost of operations of the New Pension Scheme (NPS) for such subscribers, Government will contribute Rs.1,000 per year to each NPS account opened in the year 2010-11. This initiative, \"Swavalamban\" will be available for persons who join NPS, with a minimum contribution of Rs.1,000 and a maximum contribution of Rs.12,000 per annum during the financial year 2010-11. The scheme will be available for another three years. Accordingly, I am making an allocation of Rs.100 crore for the year 2010-11. It will benefit about 10 lakh NPS subscribers of the unorganised sector. The scheme will be managed by the interim Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority.\\n\\n91.        I also appeal to the State Governments to contribute a similar amount to the scheme and participate in providing social security to the vulnerable sections of the society.\\n\\nSkill development\\n\\n92.        Prime Minister\\'s Council on National Skill Development has laid down the core governing principles for operating strategies for skill development. The Council has a mission of creating 50 crore skilled people by 2022. Of these, the target for the National Skill Development Corporation, which has started functioning from October, 2009, is 15 crore. It has completed a comprehensive skill gap study of 21 high growth sectors and approved three projects worth about Rs.45 crore to create 10 lakh skilled manpower at the rate of one lakh per annum. Other projects are in advanced stages of consideration.\\n\\n93.        It is proposed to launch an extensive skill development programme in the textile and garment sector by leveraging the strength of existing institutions and instruments of the Textile Ministry. The resources of the private sector will also be harnessed by incentivising training through an outcome - based approach. Through these instruments, the Ministry of Textiles has set an ambitious target of training 30 lakh persons over 5 years.\\n\\nSocial Welfare\\n\\n94.        I propose to step up the plan outlay for Women and Child Development by almost 50 per cent. Several new initiatives that were launched in 2009-10 are now ready for implementation. A mission for empowerment of women is being set up. The ICDS platform is being expanded for effective implementation of the Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Adolescent Girls.\\n\\n95.        To further improve female literacy rate, the Government has recast the earlier National Literacy Mission as a new programme \"Saakshar Bharat\". It was launched in September, 2009 with a target of 7 crore non-literate adults which includes 6 crore women.\\n\\n96.        A Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana to meet the specific needs of women farmers is being launched. I have provided Rs.100 crore for this initiative as a sub-component of the National Rural Livelihood Mission.\\n\\n97.        I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that I propose to enhance the plan outlay of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to Rs.4500 crore. This amounts to an increase of 80 per cent as compared to 2009-10. This will support the programmes being implemented for the target population groups covering the Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Classes, persons with disabilities, senior citizens and victims of alcoholism and substance abuse. With this enhancement, the Ministry will be able to revise rates of scholarship under its post-matric scholarship schemes for SCs and OBC students, which is long overdue.\\n\\n98.        The allocation will also assist in establishing an Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre for the benefit of the hearing impaired. District Disability Rehabilitation Centres are being set up in 50 additional districts along with two composite regional centres for persons with disabilities.\\n\\n99.        I also propose to raise the plan allocation for the Ministry of Minority Affairs from Rs.1,740 crore to Rs.2,600 crore for the year 2010-11. This marks an increase of nearly 50 per cent. I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that we are close to achieving the target of 15 per cent priority sector lending to minorities in the current year. This will be maintained for the next three years.\\n\\nSTRENGTHENING TRANSPARENCY & PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILTY\\n\\n100.      The UPA Government has made a serious attempt to create an environment that supports transparency and accountability in the working of the public institutions in the country. As Honourable Members are aware, a number of legislative and administrative measures have been taken in this regard.\\n\\nFinancial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission\\n\\n101.      Most of our legislations governing the financial sector are very old. Large number of amendments to these Acts made at different points of time has also increased ambiguity and complexity. The Government proposes to set up a Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission to rewrite and clean up the financial sector laws to bring them in line with the requirements of the sector.\\n\\nAdministrative Reforms Commission\\n\\n102.      The Administrative Reforms Commission constituted by the UPA Government in its first term has submitted 15 reports, of which 10 reports have been examined by the Government. Out of the 800 identified recommendations for implementation so far, 350 recommendations have been implemented and 450 are under implementation.\\n\\nUnique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)\\n\\n103.      In my last Budget Speech, I had announced the constitution of the Unique Identification Authority of India, its broad working principles and the timelines for delivery of the first UID numbers. I am happy to report that the Authority has been constituted and it will be able to meet its commitments of issuing the first set of UID numbers in the coming year. It would provide an effective platform for financial inclusion and targeted subsidy payments. Since the UIDAI will now get into the operational phase, I am allocating Rs.1,900 crore to the Authority for 2010-11.\\n\\nTechnology Advisory Group for Unique Projects (TAGUP)\\n\\n104.      An effective tax administration and financial governance system calls for creation of IT projects which are reliable, secure and efficient. IT projects like Tax Information Network, New Pension Scheme, National Treasury Management Agency, Expenditure Information Network, Goods and Service Tax, are in different stages of roll out. To look into various technological and systemic issues, I propose to set up a Technology Advisory Group for Unique Projects under the Chairmanship of Shri Nandan Nilekani.\\n\\nIndependent Evaluation Office (IEO)\\n\\n105.      The Government had announced the setting-up of an Independent Evaluation Office to undertake impartial and objective assessments of the various public programmes and improve the effectiveness of the public interventions.  It has been decided that it would be an independent entity under a Governing board chaired by the Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission. The IEO would evaluate the impact of flagship programmes and place the findings in the public domain. It would be funded by the Planning Commission.\\n\\nSymbol for Indian Rupee\\n\\n106.      In the ensuing year, we intend to formalise a symbol for the Indian Rupee, which reflects and captures the Indian ethos and culture. With this, Indian Rupee will join the select club of currencies such as the US Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Euro and Japanese Yen that have a clear distinguishing identity.\\n\\nSecurity and Justice\\n\\n107.      Secure borders and security of life and property fosters development. I propose to increase the allocation for Defence to Rs.1,47,344 crore. This would include Rs.60,000 crore for capital expenditure. Needless to say, any additional requirement for the security of the nation will be provided for.\\n\\n108.      In 2009-10, the overall internal security and law and order situation in the country remained largely under control. Several new measures were taken by the Government to strengthen the security apparatus of the country. These include operationalisation of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), establishment of four NSG Hubs, augmentation of the Intelligence Bureau and its Multi-Agency Centre.\\n\\n109.      There was decline in violence in Jammu and Kashmir in the year 2009. We have taken a number of confidence building measures. As one more such measure, Government proposes to recruit about 2,000 youth as constables in five Central Para Military Forces in the year 2010.\\n\\n110.      To address the development problems of the thirty three left wing extremism affected districts, a Task Force headed by the Cabinet Secretary was formed for promoting coordinated efforts across a range of development and security measures. It has been decided that Planning Commission will prepare an integrated action plan for the affected areas. Adequate funds will be made available to support the action plan. I appeal to the misguided elements to eschew violence and join the development process.\\n\\nNational Mission for Delivery of Justice and Legal Reforms\\n\\n111.      To provide timely delivery of justice to all, the Government has approved the setting up of the National Mission for Delivery of Justice and Legal Reforms. The objective of the mission is to help reduce legal backlog in courts from an average of 15 years at present to 3 years by 2012. It would also help in improving the legal environment for business. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has provided grants amounting to Rs.5,000 crore for the States to improve the delivery of justice, including strengthening of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms.\\n\\nBudget Estimates 2010-11\\n\\n            I now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2010-11.\\n\\n112.      The Gross Tax Receipts are estimated at Rs.7,46,651 crore. The Non Tax Revenue Receipts are estimated at Rs.1,48,118 crore. The net tax revenue to the Centre as well as the expenditure provisions in 2010-11 have been estimated with reference to the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.\\n\\n113.      The total expenditure proposed in the Budget Estimates for 2010-11 is Rs.11,08,749 crore, which is an increase of 8.6 per cent over the total expenditure in BE 2009-10.  The Plan and Non Plan expenditures in BE 2010-11 are estimated at Rs.3,73,092 crore and Rs.7,35,657 crore, respectively. While there is a 15 per cent increase in Plan expenditure, the increase in Non Plan expenditure is only 6 per cent over the BE of previous year.  With this level of Plan expenditure, I am confident that the total Plan expenditure would be very close to 100 per cent of the expenditure envisaged in the Eleventh Five Year Plan.\\n\\n114.      Honourable Members will agree that fiscal policy has to be guided by the required framework for fiscal prudence. In the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement presented along with Budget 2009-10, I had laid down a road map for fiscal deficit. I am happy to report that in keeping with my commitment, I have been able to present the Budget for 2010-11 with a fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent. In the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement being presented to the House today, along with other Budget documents, the rolling targets for fiscal deficit are pegged at 4.8 per cent and 4.1 per cent for 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively. These projections improve upon the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.\\n\\n115.      While presenting the Budget for 2009-10, I had expressed my concern about the high level of fiscal deficit.  I had also stated that the Government will address this issue in right earnest to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation at the earliest.  I am happy to report that against a fiscal deficit of 7.8 per cent in 2008-09, inclusive of oil and fertiliser bonds, the comparable fiscal deficit is 6.9 per cent as per the Revised Estimates for 2009-10.  Both these deficit figures are based on the revised GDP numbers published by the Central Statistical Organisation and include what were earlier referred to as below the line items. This marks an improvement of about one per cent in fiscal deficit during the current year.  I have made a conscious effort to avoid issuing bonds to oil and fertiliser companies.  I would like to continue with this practice of extending Government subsidy in cash, thereby bringing all subsidy related liabilities into our fiscal accounting.\\n\\n116.     The fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2010-11 works out to Rs.3,81,408 crore.  Taking into account the various other financing items for fiscal deficit, the actual net market borrowing of the Government in 2010-11 would be of the order of Rs.3,45,010 crore.  There will be enough space to meet the credit needs of the private sector.  The Government will plan the borrowing programme in consultation with the RBI.\\n\\n PART - B\\n\\nMadam Speaker,\\n\\n            I shall now present my tax proposals.\\n\\n117.     While formulating them, I have been guided by the principles of sound tax administration as embodied in the following words of Kautilya:\\n\\n\"Thus, a wise Collector General shall conduct the work of revenue collection.... in a manner that production and consumption should not be injuriously affected.... financial prosperity depends on public prosperity, abundance of harvest and prosperity of commerce among other things.\" \\n\\n118.     I had stated last year that tax reform is a process and not an event.  The process I had outlined in the area of direct taxes was to release a draft Direct Taxes Code along with a Discussion Paper.   In the area of indirect taxes, the reform initiative was the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax. I have presented the developments in both reform initiatives in Part \\'A\\' of my Speech.\\n\\n119.     We have continued on the path of computerisation in core areas of service delivery in the administration of direct taxes.  This will reduce the physical interface between taxpayers and tax administration and speed up procedures and processes. The Centralised Processing Centre at Bengaluru is now fully functional and is processing around 20,000 returns daily. This initiative will be taken forward by setting up two more Centres during the year.\\n\\n120.     As a part of Government\\'s initiative to move towards citizen centric governance, the income tax department has introduced \"Sevottam\", a pilot project at Pune, Kochi and Chandigarh through Aayakar Seva Kendras.  These provide a single window system for registration of all applications including those for redressal of grievances as well as paper returns. This year the scheme will be extended to four more cities.\\n\\n121.     To achieve the roll-out of GST by April 2011, the indirect tax administrations at the Centre and the States need to revamp their internal work processes based on the use of Information Technology. I am happy to inform Honorable Members that project ACES - Automation of Central Excise & Service Tax, has already been rolled out throughout the country this year. This will impart greater transparency in tax administration and improve the delivery of taxpayer services. Similarly, a Mission Mode Project for computerisation of Commercial Taxes in States has been approved recently. With an outlay of Rs.1133 crore of which the Centre\\'s share is Rs.800 crore, the project will lay the foundation for the launch of GST.\\n\\n122.     I mentioned last year, that the income tax return forms should be simple and user friendly. The income tax department is now ready to notify SARAL-II  form for individual salaried taxpayers for the coming assessment year. This form will enable individuals to enter relevant details in a simple format in only two pages.\\n\\n123.     To expeditiously resolve disputes with taxpayers I propose to expand the scope of cases which may be admitted by the Settlement Commission to include proceedings related to search and seizure cases pending for assessment. I also propose to expand the scope of Settlement Commission in respect of Central Excise and Customs so that certain categories of cases that hitherto fell outside its jurisdiction may be admitted.\\n\\n124.     Last year, amendments to the statute enabled Government to enter into tax treaties with specified territories besides sovereign states. We have commenced bi-lateral discussions to enhance the exchange of bank related and other information to effectively track tax evasion and identify undisclosed assets of resident Indians lying abroad. \\n\\nDirect Taxes\\n\\n            I shall now deal with direct taxes.\\n\\n125.     Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by enhancing the exemption limit for all taxpayers and withdrawing the surcharge on personal income tax. Taxpayers have responded positively to these concessions by contributing a higher level of taxes.  There is a persuasive case for further relief by broadening the current tax slabs which I propose as follows:\\n\\n            Income upto Rs.1.6 lakh                                                     Nil\\n\\n            Income above Rs.1.6 lakh and upto Rs.5 lakh                     10 per cent\\n\\n            Income above Rs.5 lakh and upto Rs.8 lakh                        20 per cent\\n\\n            Income above Rs.8 lakh                                                      30 per cent\\n\\n126.     The proposed broadening of tax slabs will provide substantial relief to a large number of taxpayers.\\n\\n127.     To promote savings as well as to ensure their utilisation for the thrust area of infrastructure, I propose to allow a deduction of an additional amount of Rs.20,000 for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds as notified by the Central Government.  This would be over and above the existing limit of Rs.1 lakh on tax savings.  I am sure that these reliefs will put more money in the hands of individual taxpayers for both consumption as well as saving.\\n\\n128.     Besides contributions to health insurance schemes which is currently allowed as a deduction under the Income-tax Act, I propose to allow contributions to the Central Government Health Scheme also as a deduction under the same provision. \\n\\n129.     Taking forward my initiative of phasing out surcharge, I propose to reduce the current surcharge of 10 per cent on domestic companies to 7.5 per cent.  At the same time, I propose to increase the rate of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) from the current rate of 15 per cent to 18 per cent of book profits. This will further promote inter-se equity among corporate taxpayers.\\n\\n130.     The President, in her address to the Parliament in June 2009, had declared this decade as the Decade of Innovation. Last year, I extended the scope of weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house research and development (R&D) to all manufacturing businesses except for a small negative list.  To further encourage R&D across all sectors of the economy, I now propose to enhance the weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house R&D from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. I also propose to enhance the weighted deduction on payments made to National Laboratories, research associations, colleges, universities and other institutions, for scientific research from 125 per cent to 175 per cent.\\n\\n131.     Currently, any payment made to an approved scientific research association is eligible for weighted deduction. The income of the approved scientific research association is exempt from tax. I propose that payments made to approved associations engaged in research in social sciences or statistical research would be allowed a weighted deduction of 125 per cent. The income of such approved research associations shall be exempt from tax.\\n\\n132.     In my Budget Speech last year, I stated that profit linked deductions are inherently inefficient and liable to misuse. To incentivise businesses in priority sectors, I introduced investment linked deduction as an alternative to profit linked deduction.  To give a boost to investment in the tourism sector which has high employment potential, I propose to extend the benefit of investment linked deduction under the Act to new hotels of two-star category and above anywhere in India.\\n\\n133.     To provide one time interim relief to the housing and real estate sector which was impacted by the global recession, I propose to allow pending projects to be completed within a period of five years instead of four years for claiming a deduction on their profits. I also propose to relax the norms for built-up area of shops and other commercial establishments in housing projects to enable basic facilities for their residents.\\n\\n134.     All businesses with a turnover exceeding Rs.40 lakh are currently required to have their accounts audited.  A similar provision also applies to all professions whose receipts exceed Rs.10 lakh.  I, as Finance Minister, had introduced these limits in my budget of 1984.  It is high time to reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers.  I, therefore, propose to enhance these limits to Rs.60 lakh in the case of businesses and Rs.15 lakh in the case of professions.  \\n\\n135.     To facilitate the business operations of small taxpayers, I had extended the scope of presumptive taxation to all small businesses with a turnover of up to Rs.40 lakh.   To further reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers, I now propose to enhance this limit to Rs.60 lakh. \\n\\n136.     The threshold limits of payments below which tax is not deductible at source have remained unchanged for a long time.  I propose to rationalise these thresholds. \\n\\n137.     Relaxing the current provisions on disallowance of expenditure, I propose to allow deduction of such expenditure, if tax has been deducted at any time during the financial year and paid before the due date of filing the return. This will allow most deductors additional time up to September of the next financial year.  At the same time, I propose to increase the interest charged on tax deducted but not deposited by the specified date, from 12 per cent to 18 per cent per annum. \\n\\n138.     Last year, I had provided for the taxation of the newly introduced Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) on the same lines as exists for a general partnership firm. To facilitate the conversion of small companies into LLPs, I propose that this will not be subject to capital gains tax.\\n\\n139.     Under the current provisions of the Act, \"the advancement of any other object of general public utility\" cannot be considered as \"charitable purpose\" if it involves  carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business. I have received representations from many organisations seeking some relaxation in this restriction. I propose that this restriction would not be applicable if the receipts from such activities do not exceed Rs.10 lakh in the year. \\n\\n140.     My proposals on direct taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs.26,000 crore for the year.\\n\\nIndirect Taxes\\n\\n141.     The major objectives that have guided me in the formulation of my proposals on indirect taxes are the need to achieve some degree of fiscal consolidation without impairing the recovery process and moving forward on the road to GST.\\n\\n142.     Unlike the time I presented the last Budget, symptoms of economic recovery are more widespread and clear-cut now. The three fiscal stimulus packages that the Government introduced in quick succession have helped the process of recovery significantly. The improvement in our economic performance encourages a course of fiscal correction even as the global situation warrants caution. Therefore, I propose to partially roll back the rate reduction in Central Excise duties and enhance the standard rate on all non-petroleum products from 8 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem. The specific rates of duty applicable to portland cement and cement clinker are also being adjusted upwards proportionately. Similarly, the ad valorem component of excise duty on large cars, multi-utility vehicles and sports-utility vehicles which was reduced as part of the first stimulus package, is being increased by 2 percentage points to 22 per cent.\\n\\n143.     In the wake of spiralling petroleum prices, Government provided full exemption from basic customs duty to crude petroleum and proportionately reduced the basic duty on refined petroleum products in June, 2008. Compared to the international price of the Indian crude basket of US$ 112 per barrel at that time, the prices are much softer at present. In view of the pressing need to move back to a fiscal consolidation path, I propose to restore the basic duty of 5 per cent on crude petroleum; 7.5 per cent on diesel and petrol and 10 per cent on other refined products. I also propose to enhance the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by Re.1 per litre each.\\n\\n144.     Since I quit smoking many years ago, I would urge others to also follow suit, as smoking is injurious to health. To this end, I am making some structural changes in the excise duty on cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos coupled with some increase in rates. I also propose to enhance excise duty on all non-smoking tobacco such as scented tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco etc. In addition, I propose to introduce a compounded levy scheme for chewing tobacco and branded unmanufactured tobacco based on the capacity of pouch packing machines.\\n\\n145.     Let me now turn to some much-needed incentives in thrust areas for sustainable growth and development.\\n\\nAgriculture & Related Sectors\\n\\n146.     In supporting the strategy outlined for development of agriculture earlier in my speech, I propose to address a few key areas that call for focused attention. These are:\\n\\n(i)       A strong supply chain for perishable farm produce to reach consumption and processing centres promptly;\\n\\n(ii)      Infrastructure and technology to convert such produce into value-added products; and\\n\\n(iii)     Infusion of technology to augment agricultural production.\\n\\n147.     Similar attention needs to be paid to related sectors such as apiary, horticulture, dairy, poultry, meat, marine and aquaculture.\\n\\n148.     For achieving these objectives, I propose to provide:\\n\\nâ€¢         project import status with a concessional import duty of 5 per cent for the setting up of mechanised handling systems and pallet racking systems in \\'mandis\\' or warehouses for food grains and sugar as well as full exemption from service tax for the installation and commissioning of such equipment.\\n\\nâ€¢         project import status at a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent with full exemption from service tax to the initial setting up and expansion of\\n\\nÂ»      Cold storage, cold room including farm pre-coolers for preservation or storage of agriculture and related sectors  produce ; and\\n\\nÂ»      Processing units for such produce.\\n\\nâ€¢        full exemption from customs duty to refrigeration units required for the manufacture of refrigerated vans or trucks.\\n\\n149.     I also propose to provide:\\n\\nâ€¢         concessional customs duty of 5 per cent to specified agricultural machinery not manufactured in India;\\n\\nâ€¢         central excise exemption to specified equipment for preservation, storage and processing of agriculture and related sectors and exemption from service tax to the storage and warehousing of their produce; and\\n\\nâ€¢         full exemption from excise duty to trailers and semi-trailers used in agriculture.\\n\\n150.     Concessional import duty was provided to specified machinery for use in the plantation sector in the year 2003. This exemption is to lapse in July 2010.  The modernization of this labour-intensive sector is yet to reach the expected level. I propose therefore, to extend it up to March 31, 2011 along with a CVD exemption. I hope this will provide sufficient time for the sector to achieve the desired objective.\\n\\n151.     One of the prerequisites for agricultural productivity is access to good quality and disease-resistant seeds. I propose to exempt the testing and certification of agricultural seeds from service tax.\\n\\n152.     I also propose to exempt the transportation by road of cereals and pulses from service tax. Their transportation by rail would remain exempt.\\n\\n153.     I propose two measures under the Central Excise law to ease the cash flow position for small-scale manufacturers hard hit by the economic slowdown. First, they would be permitted to take full credit of Central Excise duty paid on capital goods in a single instalment in the year of their receipt. Secondly, they would be permitted to pay Central Excise duty on a quarterly, rather than monthly basis. These measures that come into effect on the April 1, 2010 should provide them considerable relief.\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\n154.     Harnessing renewable energy sources to reduce dependence on fossil fuels is now recognised as a credible strategy for combating global warming and climate change. To build the corpus of the National Clean Energy Fund announced earlier, I propose to levy a clean energy cess on coal produced in India at a nominal rate of Rs.50 per tonne. This cess will also apply to imported coal.\\n\\n155.     In pursuance of Government\\'s resolve to implement the National Solar Mission, I propose to provide a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent to machinery, instruments, equipment and appliances etc. required for the initial setting up of photovoltaic and solar thermal power generating units. I also propose to exempt them from Central Excise duty. Similarly, ground source heat pumps used to tap geo-thermal energy would be exempt from basic customs duty and special additional duty.\\n\\n156.     Wind energy has shown promising growth in the country in recent years. As a measure of further relief, I propose to exempt a few more specified inputs required for the manufacture of rotor blades for wind energy generators from Central Excise duty.\\n\\n157.     LED lights are staging a debut as a highly energy-efficient source of lighting for streets, homes and offices. Central Excise duty on these is being reduced from 8 per cent to 4 per cent at par with Compact Fluorescent Lamps.\\n\\n158.     Full exemption from Central Excise duty was provided to electric cars and vehicles that offer an eco-friendly alternative to petrol or diesel vehicles. The manufacturers of such vehicles have expressed difficulty in neutralising the duty paid on their inputs and components. I propose to remedy this by imposing a nominal duty of 4 per cent on such vehicles. I also propose to exempt some critical parts or sub-assemblies of such vehicles from basic customs duty and special additional duty subject to actual user condition. These parts would also enjoy a concessional CVD of 4 per cent.\\n\\n159.     The humble cycle rickshaw is now being acclaimed as an environment-friendly means of transport. CSIR has developed an innovative product called \\'soleckshaw\\' to replace manually-operated rickshaws. It runs on batteries which are charged by solar power. I propose to provide a concessional excise duty of 4 per cent to this product. Its key parts and components are also being exempted from customs duty. \\n\\n160.     To encourage the use of bio-degradable materials, I propose to exempt the import of compostable polymer from basic customs duty.\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\n161.     Strengthening the public transport system is another means of reducing dependence on fossil fuels. I propose to grant project import status to \\'Monorail projects for urban transport\\' at a concessional basic duty of 5 per cent.          \\n\\n162.     Full exemption from import duty is available to specified machinery for road construction projects on the condition that the machinery shall not be sold or disposed of for a minimum period of five years. In view of representations that this leads to idling of machinery, I propose to allow resale of such machinery on payment of import duty at depreciated value. It is also being clarified that the importer is free to relocate such machinery to other eligible road construction projects.\\n\\n163.     With the subscriber base growing at 14 million per month, India is one of the fastest growing markets for mobile phone connections in the world. Domestic production of mobile phones is now picking up in view of exemptions from basic, CVD and special additional duties granted to their parts, components and accessories. To encourage the domestic manufacture of accessories, these exemptions are now being extended to parts of battery chargers and hands-free headphones. Also, the validity of the exemption from special additional duty is being extended till March 31, 2011.\\n\\nMedical Sector\\n\\n164.     Medical equipment, instruments and appliances are subjected to a very complex import duty regime based on several long lists that describe individual items. Multiple rates coupled with descriptions not aligned with tariff lines, result in disputes and at times prevent state-of-art equipment from getting the benefit of exemption. I propose to prescribe a uniform, concessional basic duty of 5 per cent, CVD of 4 per cent with full exemption from special additional duty on all medical equipment. A concessional basic duty of 5 per cent is being prescribed on parts and accessories for the manufacture of such equipment while they would be exempt from CVD and special additional duty. Full exemption currently available to medical equipment and devices such as assistive devices, rehabilitation aids etc. is being retained. The concession available to Government hospitals or hospitals set up under a statute is also being retained.\\n\\n165.     The manufacturers of orthopaedic implants have represented that their inputs attract a higher rate of duty than the finished product. I propose to exempt specified inputs for the manufacture of such implants from import duty.\\n\\nInfotainment\\n\\n166.     India is a nation of movie-goers. The film industry has been experiencing difficulties in importing digital masters of films for duplication or distribution loaded on electronic medium vis-a-vis  those imported on cinematographic film, owing to a differential customs duty structure. I propose to rationalise this by charging customs duty only on the value of the carrier medium. The same dispensation would apply to music and gaming software imported for duplication. In keeping with the tradition of Indian cinema, however, I shall provide a surprise ending. In all such cases the value representing the transfer of intellectual rights would be subjected to service tax.\\n\\n167.     Cable transmission of infotainment is undergoing a transformation with the adoption of digital technology. The multi-service operators need to invest in \"Digital Head End\" equipment. To enable this, I propose to provide project import status at a concessional customs duty of 5 per cent with full exemption from special additional duty to the initial setting up of such projects.\\n\\nPrecious Metals\\n\\n168.     The prices of precious metals continue to rise. Since the customs duty is levied on these at specific rates, I propose to index the rates as follows:\\n\\nâ€¢         On gold and platinum from Rs.200 per 10 grams to Rs.300 per 10 grams.\\n\\nâ€¢        On silver from Rs.1,000 per kg to Rs.1,500 per kg.\\n\\n169.     Gems and jewellery is a traditional item in our export basket. Rhodium - a precious metal used for polishing jewellery attracts a basic customs duty of 10 per cent. This is being reduced to 2 per cent.\\n\\n170.     To encourage domestic refining capacity for gold, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on gold ore and concentrates from 2 per cent ad valorem to a specific duty of Rs.140 per 10 grams of gold content with full exemption from special additional duty. Further, the excise duty on refined gold made from such ore or concentrate is being reduced from 8 per cent to a specific duty of Rs.280 per 10 grams.\\n\\nOther Proposals\\n\\n171.     Full exemption from import duty is available to specified inputs or raw materials required for the manufacture of sports goods which are assuming importance as an item of export. This is being expanded to cover a few more items.\\n\\n172.     In order to incentivise the domestic production of microwave ovens, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on one of its key components, namely magnetrons from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.\\n\\n173.     Presently, there is a value limit of Rs.1 lakh per annum on duty-free import of commercial samples as personal baggage. I propose to enhance this limit to Rs.3 lakh per annum.\\n\\n174.     Industry has represented that the exemption from special additional duty of 4 per cent based on refunds leads to substantial blockage of funds.  To ease this difficulty, I propose to provide an outright exemption from special additional duty to goods imported in a pre-packaged form for retail sale. This would also cover mobile phones, watches and ready-made garments even when they are not imported in pre-packaged form. The refund-based exemption is also being retained for cases not covered by the new dispensation.\\n\\n175.     Toy balloons are a source of joy to millions of children. To bring a smile to their mothers\\' faces, I propose to fully exempt them from Central Excise duty.\\n\\n176.     Some of the other relief measures that I propose are as under:\\n\\nâ€¢         Reduction in basic customs duty on long pepper from 70 per cent to 30 per cent;\\n\\nâ€¢         Reduction in basic customs duty on asafoetida from 30 per cent to 20 per cent;\\n\\nâ€¢         Reduction in central excise duty on replaceable kits for household type water filters other than those based on RO technology to 4 per cent;\\n\\nâ€¢         Reduction in central excise duty on corrugated boxes and cartons from 8 per cent to 4 per cent;\\n\\nâ€¢         Reduction in central excise duty on latex rubber thread from 8 per cent to 4 per cent; and\\n\\nâ€¢         Reduction in excise duty on goods covered under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act from 16 per cent to 10 per cent.\\n\\n177.     My proposals relating to customs and central excise are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs.43,500 crore for the year.\\n\\nService Tax\\n\\n178.     The service sector contributes nearly 60 per cent of the GDP.   The service tax to GDP ratio however, is only around 1 per cent. This sector thus, has significant potential to augment revenue.\\n\\n179.     To bridge this gap, I had the option to raise the rate of service tax to 12 per cent as it was before I introduced the third stimulus package.  I am not resorting to this option to maintain the growth momentum and also to bring about a convergence in the rates of tax on goods and services.  I, therefore, propose to retain the rate of tax on services at 10 per cent to pave the way forward for GST.\\n\\n180.     I had another option - to bring all services under service tax. I am not opting for this either at this stage. I propose, however, to bring certain services, hitherto untaxed, within the purview of the service tax levy. These are being notified separately.\\n\\n181.     I am also proposing certain legislative changes to plug revenue leakages, to remove distortions and to clarify certain doubts that have arisen over a period of time. I do not want to waste the precious time of the House elaborating the details, as they are available in the Finance Bill and other Budget documents.\\n\\n182.     Export of services, especially in the area of Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing, generates substantial employment and brings in foreign exchange. I propose to ease the process of refund of accumulated credit to exporters of services by making necessary changes in the definition of export of services and procedures.\\n\\n183.     Accredited news agencies which provide news feed online attract service tax. Acknowledging the yeoman services of such news agencies in disseminating news, I propose to exempt such news agencies that meet certain criteria, from service tax.\\n\\n184.     My proposals relating to service tax are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs.3,000 crore for the year.\\n\\n185.     Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs, central excise and service tax will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.\\n\\n186.     My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs.26,000 crore for the year. Proposals relating to Indirect Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of Rs.46,500 crore for the year. Taking into account the concessions being given in my tax proposals and measures taken to mobilise additional resources, the net revenue gain is estimated to be Rs.20,500 crore for the year.\\n\\n187.     We have emerged from the global slowdown faster than any other nation. I did not hesitate in exercising my judgement on the course of action last year and I have no hesitation in my mind now. Our actions today will determine our tomorrow.\\n\\n188.     This Budget belongs to \\'Aam Aadmi\\'.  It belongs to the farmer, the agriculturist, the entrepreneur and the investor. The opportunity is great. The time is right. I have placed my faith in the hands of the people who, I know, can be depended upon to rise to any occasion in national interest. I have placed my faith in the collective conscience of the nation that can be touched to scale undreamt of heights in the coming years.\\n\\n189.     Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Budget to the House.\\n\\n Link: https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/budget_archive/ub2010-11/bs/speecha.htm', 'Budget 2011-2012 \\n\\nSpeech of \\n\\nPranab Mukherjee \\n\\nMinister of Finance \\n\\nFebruary 28, 2011 \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\nI rise to present the Union Budget for 2011-12. \\n\\nWe are reaching the end of a remarkable fiscal year. In a globalised world \\nwith its share of uncertainties and rapid changes, this year brought us some \\nopportunities and many challenges as we moved ahead with steady steps on the \\nchosen path of fiscal consolidation and high economic growth. \\n\\n2. Our growth in 2010-11 has been swift and broad-based. The economy is \\nback to its pre-crisis growth trajectory. While agriculture has shown a rebound, \\nindustry is regaining its earlier momentum. Services sector continues its near \\ndouble digit run. Fiscal consolidation has been impressive. This year has also \\nseen significant progress in those critical institutional reforms that would set the \\npace for double-digit growth in the near future. \\n3. While we succeeded in making good progress in addressing many areas \\nof our concern, we could have done better in some others. The total food inflation \\ndeclined from 20.2 per cent in February 2010 to less than half at 9.3 per cent in \\nJanuary 2011, but it still remains a concern. In the medium term perspective, our \\nthree priorities of sustaining a high growth trajectory; making development more \\ninclusive; and improving our institutions, public delivery and governance \\npractices, remain relevant. These would continue to engage the Indian policy-\\nplanners for some time. However, there are some manifestations of these \\nchallenges that need urgent attention in the short term. \\n4. Though we have regained the pre-crisis growth momentum, there is a \\nneed to effect adjustments in the composition of growth on demand and supply \\nside. We have to ensure that along with private consumption, the revival in private \\ninvestment is sustained and matches pre-crisis growth rates at the earliest. This \\nrequires a stronger fiscal consolidation to enlarge the resource space for private \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n2 \\n\\nenterprise and addressing some policy constraints. We also have to improve the \\nsupply response of agriculture to the expanding domestic demand. Determined \\nmeasures on both these issues will help address the structural concerns on inflation \\nmanagement. It will also ensure a more stable macroeconomic environment for \\ncontinued high growth. \\n\\n5. The UPA Government has significantly scaled up the flow of resources \\nto rural areas to give a more inclusive thrust to the development process. The \\nimpact is visible in the new dynamism of our rural economy. It has helped \\nIndia navigate itself rapidly out of the quagmire of global economic slowdown. \\nYet, there is much that still needs to be done, especially in rural India. We have \\nto reconcile legitimate environmental concerns with necessary developmental \\nneeds. Above all, there is the \\'challenge of growing aspiration\\' of a young \\nIndia. \\n6. To address these concerns, I do not foresee resources being a major constraint, \\nat least not in the medium-term. However, the implementation gaps, leakages from \\npublic programmes and the quality of our outcomes are a serious challenge. \\n7. Certain events in the past few months may have created an impression of \\ndrift in governance and a gap in public accountability. Even as the Government \\nis engaged in addressing specific concerns emanating from some of these events \\nin the larger public interest and in upholding the rule of law, such an impression \\nis misplaced. We have to seize in these developments, the opportunity to improve \\nour regulatory standards and administrative practices. Corruption is a problem \\nthat we have to fight collectively. \\n8. In a complex and rapidly evolving economy, the Government can not profess \\nto be the sole repository of all knowledge. Indeed, in a democratic polity, it stands \\nto benefit from inputs from colleagues on both sides of the House. They must lend \\ntheir voice and expertise to influence public policy in the wider national interest. \\nIn some areas, good results depend on coordinated efforts of the Centre and the \\nState Governments and in some others, on favourable external developments. \\n9. I see the Budget for 2011-12 as a transition towards a more transparent \\nand result oriented economic management system in India. We are taking major \\nsteps in simplifying and placing the administrative procedures concerning \\ntaxation, trade and tariffs and social transfers on electronic interface, free of \\ndiscretion and bureaucratic delays. This will set the tone for a newer, vibrant and \\nmore efficient economy. \\n10. At times the biggest reforms are not the ones that make headline, but the \\nones concerned with the details of governance, which affect the everyday life of \\naam aadmi. In preparing this year\\'s Budget, I have been deeply conscious of this \\nfact. I am grateful for the able guidance of the Hon’ble Prime Minister and the \\nstrong support lent by UPA Chairperson Smt. Sonia Gandhi in my endeavour. I \\nwould now begin with a brief overview of the economy. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n3 \\n\\nI. Overview of the Economy \\n11. On last Friday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey \\n2010-11, which gives a detailed analysis of the economic situation of the country \\nover the past 12 months. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India is estimated \\nto have grown at 8.6 per cent in 2010-11 in real terms. In 2010-11 agriculture is \\nestimated to have grown at 5.4 per cent, industry at 8.1 per cent and services at \\n9.6 per cent. All three sectors are contributing to the consolidation of growth. \\nMore importantly, the economy has shown remarkable resilience to both external \\nand domestic shocks. \\n12. Our principal concern this year has been the continued high food prices. \\nInflation surfaced in two distinct episodes. At the beginning of the year, food \\ninflation was high for some cereals, sugar and pulses. Towards the second half, \\nwhile prices of these items moderated and even recorded negative rates of \\ninflation, there was spurt in prices of onion, milk, poultry and some vegetables. \\nOf late prices of onion have crashed in wholesale markets and we have had to \\nremove the ban on their exports. \\n13. Despite improvement in the availability of most food items, consumers \\nwere denied the benefit of seasonal fall in prices normally seen in winter months. \\nThese developments revealed shortcomings in distribution and marketing systems, \\nwhich are getting accentuated due to growing demand for these food items with \\nrising income levels. The huge differences between wholesale and retail prices \\nand between markets in different parts of the country are just not acceptable. \\nThese are at the expense of remunerative prices for farmers and competitive \\nprices for consumers. \\n14. Monetary policy stance in 2010-11, while being supportive of fiscal policy, \\nhas succeeded in keeping core-inflation in check. As the transmission lag in \\nmonetary policy tends to be long, I expect the measures already taken by the RBI \\nto further moderate inflation in coming months. \\n15. The developments on India\\'s external sector in the current year have been \\nencouraging. Even as the recovery in developed countries is gradually taking \\nroot, our trade performance has improved. Exports have grown at 29.4 per cent \\nto reach US Dollar 184.6 billion, while imports at US Dollar 273.6 billion have \\nrecorded a growth of 17.6 per cent during April-January 2010-11, over the \\ncorresponding period last year. The current account deficit is around the \\n2009-10 level and poses some concerns because of the composition of its \\nfinancing. \\n16. Policy making in a globalised world has to take into account the likely \\ninternational developments. To realise the desired outcomes, it is important that \\nthere is convergence in expectations of our investors, entrepreneurs and consumers \\non the macroeconomic prospects of the economy. Against this backdrop, the \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n4 \\n\\nIndian economy is expected to grow at 9 per cent with an outside band of +/\\n\\n\\n0.25 per cent in 2011-12. I expect the average inflation to be lower next year and \\nthe current account deficit smaller and better managed with higher domestic \\nsavings rate and stable capital flows. While, like last year, I seek the blessings of \\nLord Indra to bestow on us timely and bountiful monsoons, I would pray to \\nGoddess Lakshmi as well. I think it is a good strategy to diversify one\\'s risks. \\nII. Sustaining Growth \\n17. In my last Budget, I had started rolling back the fiscal stimulus \\nimplemented over 2008-09 and 2009-10 to mitigate the impact of the global \\nfinancial crisis on economic slowdown in India. In the course of the year, I have \\nmoved further on that path. I believe that a part of the current recovery must be \\nstored away to build future resilience. Indeed, a counter cyclical fiscal policy is \\nour best insurance against external shocks and localised domestic factors. \\nFiscal Consolidation \\n\\n18. The experience with Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, \\n2003 (FRBM Act) at Centre and the corresponding Acts at State level show that \\nstatutory fiscal consolidation targets have a positive effect on macroeconomic \\nmanagement of the economy. In the course of the year the Central Government \\nwould introduce an amendment to the FRBM Act, laying down the fiscal road \\nmap for the next five years. \\n19. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has worked out a fiscal consolidation \\nroad map for States requiring them to eliminate revenue deficit and achieve a \\nfiscal deficit of 3 per cent of their respective Gross State Domestic Product latest \\nby 2014-15. It has also recommended a combined States’ debt target of 24.3 per \\ncent of GDP to be reached during this period. The States are required to amend \\nor enact their FRBM Acts to conform to these recommendations. \\n20. The Government has been in the process of setting-up an independent \\nDebt Management Office in the Finance Ministry. A Middle Office is already \\noperational. As a next step, I propose to introduce the Public Debt Management \\nAgency of India Bill in the next financial year. \\nTax Reforms \\n\\n21. The introduction of the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) and the proposed Goods \\nand Services Tax (GST) will mark a watershed. These reforms will result in \\nmoderation of rates, simplification of laws and better compliance. \\n22. As Hon\\'ble Members are aware, the Direct Taxes Code Bill was introduced \\nin Parliament in August, 2010. After receiving the report of the Standing \\nCommittee, we shall be able to finalise the Code for its enactment during \\n2011-12. This has been a pioneering effort in participative legislation. The Code \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n5 \\n\\nis proposed to be effective from April 1, 2012 to allow taxpayers, practitioners \\nand administrators to fully understand the legislation and adjust to the revised \\nprocedures. \\n\\n23. Unlike DTC, decisions on the GST have to be taken in concert with the \\nStates with whom our dialogue has made considerable progress in the last four \\nyears. Areas of divergence have been narrowed. As a step towards the roll-out of \\nGST, I propose to introduce the Constitution Amendment Bill in this session of \\nParliament. Work is also underway on drafting of the model legislation for the \\nCentral and State GST. \\n24. Among the other steps that are being taken for the introduction of GST is \\nthe establishment of a strong IT infrastructure. We have made significant progress \\non the GST Network (GSTN). The key business processes of registration, returns \\nand payments are in advanced stages of finalisation. The National Securities \\nDepository Limited (NSDL) has been selected as technology partner for \\nincubating the National Information Utility that will establish and operate the IT \\nbackbone for GST. By June 2011, NSDL will set up a Pilot portal in collaboration \\nwith eleven States prior to its roll out across the country. \\nExpenditure Reforms \\n\\n25. The effective management of public expenditure is an integral part of the \\nfiscal consolidation process. Expenditure has to be oriented towards the \\nproduction of public goods and services. The extant classification of public \\nexpenditure between plan, non-plan, revenue and capital spending needs to be \\nrevisited. This is necessary as one recognises the importance of service sector \\nand the knowledge economy for our development. A Committee under \\nDr. C. Rangarajan has been set up by the Planning Commission to look into \\nthese issues. \\nSubsidies \\n\\n26. During the year 2010-11, the Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) policy was \\nsuccessfully implemented for all fertilisers except urea. The policy has been \\nwell received by all stakeholders, and the availability of fertilisers has improved. \\nThe extension of the NBS regime to cover urea is under active consideration of \\nthe Government. \\n27. The Government provides subsidies, notably on fuel and food grains, to \\nenable the common man to have access to these basic necessities at affordable \\nprices. A significant proportion of subsidised fuel does not reach the targeted \\nbeneficiaries and there is large scale diversion of subsidised kerosene oil. A recent \\ntragic event has highlighted this practice. We have deliberated for long the \\nmodalities of implementing such subsidies. The debate now has to make way for \\ndecision. To ensure greater efficiency, cost effectiveness and better delivery for \\nboth kerosene and fertilisers, the Government will move towards direct transfer \\nof cash subsidy to people living below poverty line in a phased manner. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n6 \\n\\n28. A task force headed by Shri Nandan Nilekani has been set-up to work \\nout the modalities for the proposed system of direct transfer of subsidy for \\nkerosene, LPG and fertilisers. The interim report of the task force is expected by \\nJune 2011. The system will be in place by March 2012. \\nPeople’s Ownership of PSUs \\n\\n29. The Government\\'s programme to broadbase the ownership of Central \\nPublic Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) has received an overwhelming response. \\nThe six public issues of CPSUs in the current financial year have attracted around \\n50 lakh retail investors. \\n30. As against a target of `40,000 crore, the Government will raise about \\n`22,144 crore from disinvestment in 2010-11. A higher than anticipated realisation \\nin non-tax revenues has led us to reschedule some of the divestment issues planned \\nfor the current year. I intend to maintain the momentum on disinvestment in \\n2011-12 by raising `40,000 crore. Let me reiterate here that the Government is \\ncommitted to retain at least 51 per cent ownership and management control of the \\nCPSUs, as stated earlier in my Budget speech for 2009-10. \\nInvestment Environment \\n\\nForeign Direct Investment \\n\\n31. To make the FDI policy more user-friendly, all prior regulations and \\nguidelines have been consolidated into one comprehensive document, which is \\nreviewed every six months. The last review has been released in September \\n2010. This has been done with the specific intent of enhancing clarity and \\npredictability of our FDI policy to foreign investors. Discussions are underway \\nto further liberalise the FDI policy. \\nForeign Institutional Investors \\n\\n32. Currently, only FIIs and sub-accounts registered with the SEBI and NRIs \\nare allowed to invest in mutual fund schemes. To liberalise the portfolio \\ninvestment route, it has been decided to permit SEBI registered Mutual Funds \\nto accept subscriptions from foreign investors who meet the KYC requirements \\nfor equity schemes. This would enable Indian Mutual Funds to have direct \\naccess to foreign investors and widen the class of foreign investors in Indian \\nequity market. \\n33. To enhance the flow of funds to the infrastructure sector, the FII limit for \\ninvestment in corporate bonds, with residual maturity of over five years issued \\nby companies in infrastructure sector, is being raised by an additional limit of \\nUS Dollar 20 billion taking the limit to US Dollar 25 billion. This will raise the \\ntotal limit available to the FIIs for investment in corporate bonds to US Dollar \\n40 billion. Since most of the infrastructure companies are organised in the form \\nof SPVs, FIIs would also be permitted to invest in unlisted bonds with a minimum \\nlock-in period of three years. However, the FIIs will be allowed to trade amongst \\nthemselves during the lock-in period. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n7 \\n\\nFinancial Sector legislative Initiatives \\n\\n34. The financial sector reforms initiated during the early 1990s have borne \\ngood results for the Indian economy. The UPA Government is committed to \\ntake this process further. Accordingly, I propose to move the following legislations \\nin the financial sector: \\n(i) The Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2008; \\n(ii) The Life Insurance Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2009; \\n(iii) The revised Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority \\nBill, first introduced in 2005; \\n(iv) Banking Laws Amendment Bill, 2011; \\n(v) Bill on Factoring and Assignment of Receivables; \\n(vi) The State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks Laws) Amendment Bill, \\n2009; and \\n(vii) Bill to amend RDBFI Act 1993 and SARFAESI Act 2002. \\n35. In my last Budget speech, I had announced that Reserve Bank of India \\nwould consider giving some additional banking licences to private sector players. \\nAccordingly, RBI issued a discussion paper in August, 2010, inviting feedback \\nfrom the public. RBI has proposed some amendments in the Banking Regulation \\nAct. I propose to bring suitable legislative amendments in this regard in this \\nsession. RBI is planning to issue the guidelines for banking licences before the \\nclose of this financial year. \\nPublic Sector Bank Recapitalisation \\n\\n36. During the year 2010-11, the Government is providing a sum of `20,157 \\ncrore for infusion in the Public Sector Banks to maintain Tier I Capital to Risk \\nWeighted Asset Ratio (CRAR) at 8 per cent and increase government equity in some \\nbanks to 58 per cent. I propose to provide a sum of `6,000 crore for the year 2011-12 \\nto enable Public Sector Banks to maintain a minimum Tier I CRAR at 8 per cent. \\nRecapitalisation of Regional Rural Banks \\n\\n37. As a part of financial strengthening of Regional Rural Banks, an amount \\nof `350 crore was given to these banks during this year. I propose to provide \\n`500 crore during 2011-12 to enable them maintain a CRAR of at least 9 per \\ncent as on March 31, 2012. \\nMicro Finance Institutions \\n\\n38. The Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) have emerged as an important \\nmeans of financial inclusion. Creation of a dedicated fund for providing equity \\nto smaller MFIs would help them maintain growth and achieve scale and \\nefficiency in operations. I propose to create in the course of the year, \"India \\nMicrofinance Equity Fund\" of `100 crore with SIDBI. To empower women and \\npromote their Self Help Groups (SHGs), I propose to create a “Women’s SHG’s \\nDevelopment Fund” with a corpus of `500 crore. The Committee set up by RBI \\nto look into issues relating to micro finance sector in India has submitted its \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n8 \\n\\nreport. The Government is considering putting in place appropriate framework \\nto protect the interests of small borrowers. \\n\\nRural Infrastructure Development Fund \\n\\n39. The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) is an important \\ninstrument for routing bank funds for financing rural infrastructure. This is popular \\namong State Governments. I propose to raise the corpus of RIDF XVII to `18,000 \\ncrore in 2011-12 from `16,000 crore in the current year. The additional allocation \\nwould be dedicated to creation of warehousing facilities. \\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises \\n\\n40. Micro and Small enterprises play a crucial role in furthering the objective \\nof equitable and inclusive growth. Last year, `4,000 crore was provided to SIDBI \\nfor refinancing incremental lending by banks to these enterprises. For the year \\n2011-12, I propose to provide `5,000 crore to SIDBI for the same purpose out of \\nthe shortfall of banks on priority sector lending targets. \\n41. Handloom weavers have been facing economic stress. Consequently, \\nmany of them have not been able to repay debts to handloom weaver cooperative \\nsocieties which have become financially unviable. I propose to provide `3,000 \\ncrore to NABARD, in phases for these cooperative societies. The initiative would \\nbenefit 15,000 cooperative societies and about 3 lakh handloom weavers. The \\ndetails of the scheme would be worked out by the Ministry of Textiles in \\nconsultation with Planning Commission. \\n42. I am happy to report that the outstanding loans to minority communities \\nwhich stood at 13 per cent of total priority sector lending at the end of last year \\nhave increased to 13.6 per cent in the current year. I have directed the Public \\nSector Banks to achieve the target of 15 per cent at the earliest. \\nHousing Sector Finance \\n\\n43. To further stimulate growth in housing sector, I am liberalising the existing \\nscheme of interest subvention of 1 per cent on housing loans by extending it to \\nhousing loan upto `15 lakh where the cost of the house does not exceed `25 lakh \\nfrom the present limit of `10 lakh and `20 lakh respectively. \\n44. On account of increase in prices of residential properties in urban areas, \\nI propose to enhance the existing housing loan limit from `20 lakh to `25 lakh \\nfor dwelling units under priority sector lending. \\n45. To provide housing finance to targeted groups in rural areas at competitive \\nrates, I propose to enhance the provision under Rural Housing Fund to `3,000 \\ncrore from the existing `2,000 crore. \\n46. Credit enablement of Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and LIG \\nhouseholds is a serious challenge. To address this issue, I propose to create a \\nMortgage Risk Guarantee Fund under Rajiv Awas Yojana. This would guarantee \\nhousing loans taken by EWS and LIG households and enhance their credit \\nworthiness. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n9 \\n\\n47. To prevent frauds in loan cases involving multiple lending from different \\nbanks on the same immovable property, the Government has facilitated setting \\nup of Central Electronic Registry under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. This Registry \\nwill become operational by March 31, 2011. \\nFinancial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission \\n\\n48. In pursuance of the announcement made in Budget 2010-11, the \\nGovernment has set up a Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission under \\nthe Chair of Justice B. N. Srikrishna. It would rewrite and streamline the financial \\nsector laws, rules and regulations and bring them in harmony with the \\nrequirements of a modern financial sector. The Commission will complete its \\nwork in 24 months. \\n49. The Companies Bill introduced in the Parliament in 2009 has been \\nreceived from the Parliamentary Standing Committee. The proposed bill will be \\nintroduced in the Lok Sabha in the current session. \\nAgriculture \\n\\n50. Agriculture development is central to our growth strategy. Measures taken \\nduring the current year have started attracting private investment in agriculture \\nand agro-processing activities. This process has to be deepened further. \\n51. In the Budget for 2010-11, I had delineated a four-pronged strategy \\ncovering agricultural production, reduction in wastage of produce, credit support \\nto farmers and a thrust to the food processing sector. These initiatives have \\nstarted showing results but there are other issues in our food economy that require \\nattention. The recent spurt in food prices was driven by increase in the prices of \\nitems like fruits and vegetables, milk, meat, poultry and fish, which account for \\nmore than 70 per cent of the WPI basket for primary food items. Removal of \\nproduction and distribution bottlenecks for these items will be the focus of my \\nattention this year. I propose to make allocations for these schemes under the \\nongoing Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) for an early take off. The total \\nallocation of RKVY is being increased from `6,755 crore in 2010-11 to `7,860 \\ncrore in 2011-12. \\nBringing Green Revolution to Eastern Region \\n\\n52. The Green Revolution in Eastern Region is waiting to happen. To realize \\nthe potential of the region, last year\\'s initiative will be continued in 2011-12 with \\na further allocation of `400 crore. The program would target the improvement in \\nthe rice based cropping system of Assam, West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand, \\nEastern Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. \\nIntegrated Development of 60,000 pulses villages in rainfed areas \\n\\n53. Government\\'s initiative on pulses has received a positive response from \\nthe farmers. As per the second advance estimates, a record production of 165 \\nlakh tonnes of pulses is expected this year as against 147 lakh tonnes last year. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n10 \\n\\nWhile consolidating these gains, we must strive to attain self-sufficiency in \\nproduction of pulses within next three years. I propose to provide an amount of \\n`300 crore to promote 60,000 pulses villages in rainfed areas for increasing crop \\nproductivity and strengthening market linkages. \\n\\nPromotion of Oil Palm \\n\\n54. The domestic production of edible oil meets only about 50 per cent \\ndemand. The gap in supply is met through imports, which are often at high \\nprices due to the quantum of our requirement. Our recent interventions and \\ngood rains are expected to result in a higher oilseeds production of 278 lakh \\ntonnes in 2010-11 as against 249 lakh tonnes in 2009-10. To achieve a major \\nbreakthrough, we have to pay special attention to oil palm as it is one of the \\nmost efficient oil crops. I propose to provide an amount of `300 crore to bring \\n60,000 hectares under oil palm plantation, by integrating the farmers with the \\nmarkets. The initiative will yield about 3 lakh metric tonnes of palm oil annually \\nin 5 years. \\nInitiative on Vegetable Clusters \\n\\n55. The growing demand for vegetables has to be met by a robust increase \\nin the productivity and market linkage. An efficient supply chain, to provide \\nquality vegetables at competitive prices will have to be established. I propose to \\nprovide an amount of `300 crore for implementation of vegetable initiative to \\nset in motion a virtuous cycle of higher production and incomes for the farmers. \\nTo begin with, this programme will be launched near major urban centres. \\nNutri-cereals \\n\\n56. While we ensure food for all, we must also promote balanced nutrition. \\nBajra, jowar, ragi and other millets are highly nutritious and are known to possess \\nseveral medicinal properties. The availability and consumption of these Nutricereals \\nis, however, low and has been steadily declining over recent years. A \\nprovision of `300 crore is being made to promote higher production of these \\ncereals, upgrade their processing technologies and create awareness regarding \\ntheir health benefits. This initiative would provide market linked production \\nsupport to ten lakh millet farmers in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. \\nThe programme would be taken up in 1000 compact blocks covering about 25,000 \\nvillages. This will help improve nutritional security and increase feed and fodder \\nsupply for livestock. \\nNational Mission for Protein Supplements \\n\\n57. The consumption of foods rich in animal protein and other nutrients has \\nrisen of late, with demand growing faster than production. The National Mission \\nfor Protein Supplements is being launched in 2011-12 with an allocation of `300 \\ncrore. It will take up activities to promote animal based protein production through \\nlivestock development, dairy farming, piggery, goat rearing and fisheries in \\nselected blocks. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n11 \\n\\nAccelerated Fodder Development Programme \\n\\n58. Adequate availability of fodder is essential for sustained production of \\nmilk. It is necessary to accelerate the production of fodder through intensive \\npromotion of technologies to ensure its availability throughout the year. I \\npropose to provide `300 crore for Accelerated Fodder Development Programme \\nwhich will benefit farmers in 25,000 villages. \\n59. Hon\\'ble Members may be curious as to why all these new initiatives \\nare being launched with an allocation of `300 crore. Well, the number 3 happens \\nto be my lucky number ! \\nNational Mission for Sustainable Agriculture \\n\\n60. While the need to maximize crop yields to meet the growing demand \\nfor food grains is critical, we have to sustain agricultural productivity in the \\nlong run. There has been deterioration in soil health due to removal of crop \\nresidues and indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers, aided by distorted prices. \\n61. To address these issues, the Government proposes to promote organic \\nfarming methods, combining modern technology with traditional farming \\npractices like green manuring, biological pest control and weed management. \\nAgriculture Credit \\n\\n62. To get the best from their land, farmers need access to affordable credit. \\nBanks have been consistently meeting the targets set for agriculture credit flow \\nin the past few years. For the year 2011-12, I am raising the target of credit \\nflow to the farmers from `3,75,000 crore this year to `4,75,000 crore in 201112. \\nBanks have been asked to step up direct lending for agriculture and credit \\nto small and marginal farmers. \\n63. The existing interest subvention scheme of providing short term crop \\nloans to farmers at 7 per cent interest will be continued during 2011-12. In the \\nlast budget, I had provided an additional 2 per cent interest subvention to those \\nfarmers who repay their crop loans on time. The response to this scheme has \\nbeen good. In order to provide further incentive to these farmers, I propose to \\nenhance the additional subvention to 3 per cent in 2011-12. Thus, the effective \\nrate of interest for such farmers will be 4 per cent per annum. \\n64. In view of the enhanced target for flow of agriculture credit, I propose \\nto strengthen NABARD\\'s capital base by infusing `3000 crore, in a phased \\nmanner, as Government equity. This would raise its paid-up capital to `5,000 \\ncrore. To enable NABARD refinance the short-term crop loans of the \\ncooperative credit institutions and RRBs at concessional rates, I propose a \\ncontribution of `10,000 crore to NABARD’s Short-term Rural Credit Fund for \\n2011-12 from the shortfall in priority sector lending by Scheduled Commercial \\nBanks. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n12 \\n\\nMega Food Parks \\n\\n65. Despite growing production of vegetables and fruits, their availability is \\ninadequate due to bottlenecks in retailing capacity. An estimated 40 per cent of \\nthe fruit and vegetable production in India goes waste due to lack of storage, \\ncold chain and transport infrastructure. To address these issues, the Eleventh \\nPlan target for number of Mega Food Parks was set at 30. So far, 15 such parks \\nhave been sanctioned. During 2011-12, approval is being given to set up 15 \\nmore Mega Food Parks. \\nStorage Capacity and Cold Chains \\n\\n66. The years 2008 to 2010 saw very high levels of foodgrain procurement. \\nOn January 1, 2011, the foodgrain stock in Central pool reached 470 lakh metric \\ntonnes, 2.7 times higher than 174 lakh metric tonnes on January 1, 2007. The \\nstorage capacity for such large quantities requires augmentation. Process to create \\nnew storage capacity of 150 lakh metric tonnes through private entrepreneurs \\nand warehousing corporations has been fast tracked. Decision to create 20 lakh \\nmetric tonnes of storage capacity under Public Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) \\nScheme through modern silos has been taken. While we will be able to add \\nabout 2.6 lakh tonnes of capacity by March 2011, based on existing sanctions, \\nthe addition will reach 40 lakh tonnes by March 2012. During 2010-11, another \\n24 lakh metric tonnes of storage capacity has been created under the Rural \\nGodown Scheme. \\n67. Investment in cold storage projects is now gaining momentum. During \\nthis year, 24 cold storage projects with a capacity of 1.4 lakh metric tonnes have \\nbeen sanctioned under National Horticulture Mission. In addition, 107 cold \\nstorage projects with a capacity of over 5 lakh metric tonnes have been approved \\nby the National Horticulture Board. \\n68. To attract investment in this sector, henceforth, capital investment in the \\ncreation of modern storage capacity will be eligible for viability gap funding \\nscheme of the Finance Ministry. It is also proposed to recognize cold chains and \\npost-harvest storage as an infrastructure sub-sector. \\nAgriculture Produce Marketing Act \\n\\n69. The recent episode of inflation in vegetables and fruits has exposed serious \\nflaws in our supply chains. The government regulated mandis sometimes prevent \\nretailers from integrating their enterprises with the farmers. There is need for the \\nState Governments to review and enforce a reformed Agriculture Produce \\nMarketing Act urgently. \\nInfrastructure and Industry \\n\\n70. Infrastructure is critical for our development. For 2011-12, an allocation \\nof over ` 2,14,000 crore is being made for this sector, which is 23.3 per cent \\nhigher than current year. This amounts to 48.5 per cent of the Gross Budgetary \\nSupport to plan expenditure. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n13 \\n\\n71. Our experience with PPP model for creation of public sector assets in the \\ncountry has been good. We have recently launched the National Capacity Building \\nProgramme to enhance capacities of public functionaries in identifying, \\nconceptualising, structuring and managing PPPs. It is our endeavour to come up \\nwith a comprehensive policy that can be used by the Centre and the State \\nGovernments in further developing public-private partnerships. \\n72. Government established India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited \\n(IIFCL) to provide long term financial assistance to infrastructure projects. It is \\nexpected to achieve a cumulative disbursement target of `20,000 crore by March \\n31, 2011 and `25,000 crore by March 31, 2012. The take out financing scheme \\nannounced in the Budget 2009-10 has been implemented and seven projects \\nhave been sanctioned with a debt of `1,500 crore. Another `5,000 crore will be \\nsanctioned during 2011-12. \\n73. In order to give a boost to infrastructure development in railways, ports, \\nhousing and highways development, I propose to allow tax free bonds of `30,000 \\ncrore to be issued by various Government undertakings in the year 2011-12. \\nThis includes Indian Railway Finance Corporation `10,000 crore, National \\nHighway Authority of India `10,000 crore, HUDCO `5,000 crore and Ports `5,000 \\ncrore. \\n74. To attract foreign funds for the infrastructure financing, I propose to create \\nSpecial Vehicles in the form of notified infrastructure debt funds. I will come to \\nthe details in Part B of my speech. \\nNational Manufacturing Policy \\n\\n75. For sustained growth of GDP and productive employment for younger \\ngeneration, it is imperative that the growth in manufacturing sector picks up. We \\nexpect to take the share of manufacturing in GDP from about 16 per cent to 25 \\nper cent over a period of ten years. Government will come out with a \\nmanufacturing policy, which will bring down the compliance burden on the \\nindustry through self-regulation and help make Indian industry globally \\ncompetitive. \\n76. To address the need for greater transparency and accountability in \\nprocurement policy and allocation, pricing and utilisation of natural resources, \\nthe Government has set up two committees. The recommendations will be \\navailable within three months. \\n77. A Group of Ministers has been set up to consider all issues relating to \\nreconciliation of environmental concerns emanating from various departmental \\nactivities including those related to infrastructure and mining. This Group will \\nalso suggest changes in the existing statutes, rules, regulations and guidelines \\nand make its recommendations in a time bound manner. \\n78. The Indian automobile market is the second fastest growing in the world \\nand has shown nearly 30 per cent growth this year. World over, substantial \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n14 \\n\\ninvestments are being made in the field of hybrid and electric mobility. To provide \\ngreen and clean transportation for the masses, National Mission for Hybrid and \\nElectric Vehicles will be launched in collaboration with all stakeholders. \\n\\n79. The funding of 15,260 modern low floor and semi-low floor buses under \\nJNNURM, besides adding to passenger comfort, has transformed the urban \\ntransport across India. In 2011-12, Delhi Metro Phase-III and Mumbai Metro \\nLine III are proposed to be taken up. The ongoing Metro projects of Bengaluru, \\nKolkata and Chennai will be provided financial assistance for speedy \\nimplementation. \\n80. Investment in fertilizer sector is capital intensive and is considered high \\nrisk. It is proposed to include capital investment in fertiliser production as an \\ninfrastructure sub-sector. \\nExports \\n\\n81. The Task Force on Transactions Cost set up by the Department of \\nCommerce to identify and suggest ways to achieve improvement in efficiency of \\nour export processes, has completed its work. Twenty one suggestions made by \\nthe Task Force have already been implemented. Action on remaining two will be \\ntaken in next few months. This will mitigate transactions cost by about `2,100 \\ncrore. \\n82. To quicken the clearance of the cargo by Customs authorities and further \\nmodernise the Customs administration, I propose to introduce self-assessment \\nin Customs. Under this, importers and exporters will themselves assess their \\nduty liabilities while filing their declarations in the EDI system. The Department \\nwill verify such assessments on a selective system driven basis. \\n83. There have been considerable difficulties in the sanction of refunds \\nrelating to tax paid on services used for export of goods. I propose to shortly \\nintroduce a scheme for the refund of these taxes on the lines of drawback of \\nduties in a far more simplified and expeditious manner. A new scheme is also \\nbeing introduced by which units in SEZs will be able to obtain tax-free receipt of \\nservices wholly consumed within the zone and get their refunds in a much easier \\nmanner. \\n84. Mega clusters have large employment and export potential. I propose to \\nextend the Mega Cluster Scheme for development of leather products. Seven \\nmega leather clusters would be set up during the year 2011-12. I also propose to \\ninclude Jodhpur for the development of a handicraft mega cluster. \\nBlack Money \\n\\n85. The generation and circulation of black money is an area of serious \\nconcern. To deal with this problem effectively, Government has put into operation \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n15 \\n\\na five-fold strategy which consists of Joining the global crusade against \\'black \\nmoney\\'; Creating an appropriate legislative framework; Setting up institutions \\nfor dealing with illicit funds; Developing systems for implementation; and \\nImparting skills to the manpower for effective action. \\n\\n86. We secured Membership of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in \\nJune last year. This is an important initiative of G-20 for anti-money laundering. \\nWe have also joined the Task Force on Financial Integrity and Economic \\nDevelopment, Eurasian Group (EAG) and Global Forum on Transparency and \\nExchange of Information for Tax Purposes. \\n87. During the year, we have concluded discussions for 11 Tax Information \\nExchange Agreements (TIEAs) and 13 new Double Taxation Avoidance \\nAgreements (DTAAs) along with revision of provisions of 10 existing DTAAs. \\nTo effectively handle the increase in tax information exchange and transfer \\npricing issues, Foreign Tax Division of CBDT has been strengthened. A \\ndedicated Cell for exchange of information is being set up to work on this \\nagenda. \\n88. The amendment in our Money Laundering Legislation in 2009 has \\nsignificantly increased its scope and application. The number of cases registered \\nunder this law has increased from 50 between 2005 to 2008 to over 1200 by \\nJanuary this year. The strength of the Enforcement Directorate has been increased \\nthree-fold to deal effectively with the increased workload. \\n89. The Ministry of Finance has commissioned a study on unaccounted \\nincome and wealth held within and outside our country. It would suggest methods \\nto tax and repatriate this illicit money. \\n90. Trafficking in narcotic drugs is also a contributor to the generation of \\nblack money. To strengthen controls over prevention of trafficking and improve \\nthe management of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, I propose to \\nannounce a comprehensive national policy in the near future. \\nIII. Strengthening Inclusion \\n91. The UPA Government has engineered a major directional change in public \\npolicy by its focus on inclusive development. Creation of legal entitlements for \\nan individual\\'s right to work has added to resilience and dynamism in our rural \\neconomy. The right to information and the right to education are effective tools \\nof empowerment for removing social imbalances. The country has carried for \\nlong enough the burden of hunger and malnutrition. After detailed consultations \\nwith all stakeholders including State Governments, we are close to the finalisation \\nof National Food Security Bill (NFSB) which will be introduced in the Parliament \\nduring the course of this year. The proposed allocation of ` 1,60,887 crore for \\nsocial sector in 2011-12 is an increase of 17 per cent over current year. It amounts \\nto 36.4 per cent of the total plan allocation. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n16 \\n\\nBharat Nirman \\n\\n92. The UPA Government\\'s flagship programmes have been the principal \\ninstrument for implementing its agenda for inclusive development. For the \\nyear 2011-12, Bharat Nirman, which includes Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak \\nYojna (PMGSY), Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme, Rajiv Gandhi \\nGrameen Vidyutikaran Yojna, Indira Awas Yojna, National Rural Drinking \\nWater Programme and Rural telephony have together been allocated `58,000 \\ncrore. This is an increase of `10,000 crore from the current year. A plan has \\nbeen finalised to provide Rural Broadband Connectivity to all 2,50,000 \\nPanchayats in the country in three years. \\nMGNREGA \\n\\n93. In pursuance of my earlier budget announcement to provide a real wage \\nof `100 per day, the Government has decided to index the wage rates notified \\nunder the MGNREGA to the Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour. \\nThe enhanced wage rates have been notified by the Ministry of Rural \\nDevelopment on January 14, 2011. It has resulted in significant enhancement \\nof wages for the beneficiaries across the country. \\n94. The Anganwadi workers and Anganwadi helpers are the backbone of \\nIntegrated Child Development Services Scheme. I am happy to announce an \\nincrease in the remuneration of Anganwadi workers from `1,500 per month to \\n`3,000 per month and for Anganwadi helpers from `750 per month to `1,500 \\nper month. This will be effective from April 1, 2011. Around 22 lakh Anganwadi \\nworkers and helpers will benefit from the increase. \\nScheduled Castes and Tribal Sub-plan \\n\\n95. In the Budget for 2011-12, for the first time, specific allocations are \\nbeing earmarked towards Scheduled Castes Sub-plan and Tribal Sub-plan. \\nThese will be shown in the Budget of the relevant Ministries and Departments \\nunder separate minor heads of account. Further, I propose to increase the Budget \\nallocation for primitive tribal groups from `185 crore in 2010-11 to `244 crore \\nin 2011-12. \\nEducation \\n\\n96. Our “demographic dividend” of a relatively younger population \\ncompared to developed countries is as much of an opportunity as it is a \\nchallenge. Over 70 per cent of Indians will be of working age in 2025. In this \\ncontext, universalising access to secondary education, increasing the percentage \\nof our scholars in higher education and providing skill training is necessary. \\nFor education, I propose an allocation of ` 52,057 crore, which is an increase \\nof 24 per cent over the current year. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n17 \\n\\nSarva Shiksha Abhiyan \\n\\n97. The existing operational norms of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan have been \\nrevised to implement the right of children to free and compulsory education \\nwhich has come into force with effect from April 1, 2010. For the year 2011-12, \\nI propose to allocate `21,000 crore which is 40 per cent higher than `15,000 \\ncrore allocated in the Budget for 2010-11. A revised Centrally Sponsored Scheme \\n“Vocationalisation of Secondary Education” will be implemented from 2011-12 \\nto improve the employability of our youth. \\n98. Empowerment flows from Education. While the Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes had access to post matric scholarships, there was so far a lack \\nof pre matric scholarship scheme. In 2011-12, I propose to introduce a scholarship \\nscheme for needy students belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled \\nTribes studying in classes ninth and tenth. It would benefit about 40 lakh \\nScheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students. \\nNational Knowledge Network \\n\\n99. Approved in March 2010, the National Knowledge Network (NKN) will \\nlink 1500 Institutes of Higher Learning and Research through an optical fibre \\nbackbone. During the current year, 190 Institutes will be connected to NKN. \\nSince the core will be ready by March 2011, the connectivity to all 1500 \\ninstitutions will be provided by March 2012. \\nInnovations \\n\\n100. To move beyond the formal R&D paradigm, a National Innovation \\nCouncil under Shri Sam Pitroda has been set up to prepare a roadmap for \\ninnovations in India. The process of setting up State Innovation Councils in \\neach State and Sectoral Innovation Councils aligned to Central Ministries is \\nunderway. \\n101. The Government has been providing special grants to recognise excellence \\nin universities and academic institutions. In the course of 2011-12, I propose to \\nprovide: \\n• `50 crore each to upcoming centres of Aligarh Muslim University \\nat Murshidabad in West Bengal and Malappuram in Kerala; \\n• `100 crore as one-time grant to the Kerala Veterinary and Animal \\nSciences University at Pookode, Kerala; \\n• `10 crore each for setting up Kolkata and Allahabad Centres of \\nMahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya, Wardha; \\n• `200 crore as one time grant to IIT, Kharagpur; \\n• `20 crore for Rajiv Gandhi National Institute of Youth \\nDevelopment, Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu \\n\\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n18 \\n\\n• `20 crore for IIM, Kolkata, to set up its Financial Research and \\nTrading Laboratory; \\n• `200 crore for Maulana Azad Education Foundation; \\n• `10 crore for Centre for Development Economics and Ratan Tata \\nLibrary, Delhi School of Economics, Delhi; and \\n• `10 crore for Madras School of Economics. \\n\\nSkill Development \\n\\n102. I am happy to inform the House that National Skill Development Council \\n(NSDC) is well on course to achieve its mandate of creation of 15 crore skilled \\nworkforce two years ahead of 2022, the stipulated target year. It has already \\nsanctioned 26 projects with a total funding of `658 crore. These projects alone \\nare expected to create more than 4 crore skilled workforce over the next ten \\nyears. In the current year, skill training has so far been provided to 20,000 persons. \\nOf these, 75 per cent have found placements. I will provide an additional `500 \\ncrore to the National Skill Development Fund during the next year. \\n103. National celebrations of 150th Birth Anniversary of Gurudev \\nRabindranath Tagore will commence from May 7, 2011 in New Delhi. \\nImportant events will be held in several countries in Europe, America and \\nAsia. A series of events are also proposed to be organized under the aegis of \\njoint India-Bangladesh Celebrations Committee. An international award with \\nprize money of `1 crore is being instituted for promoting values of Universal \\nBrotherhood in the memory of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore. \\nHealth \\n\\n104. For health, I propose to step up the plan allocations in 2011-12 by 20 per \\ncent to `26,760 crore. The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana has emerged as an \\neffective instrument for providing a basic health cover to poor and marginal \\nworkers. It is now being extended to MGNREGA beneficiaries, beedi workers \\nand others. In 2011-12, I propose to further extend this scheme to cover \\nunorganized sector workers in hazardous mining and associated industries like \\nslate and slate pencil, dolomite, mica and asbestos etc. \\nFinancial Inclusion \\n\\n105. In my last budget speech I had advised Banks to provide banking \\nfacilities to habitations having a population of over 2000 by March, 2012. The \\nBanks have identified about 73,000 such habitations for providing banking \\nfacilities using appropriate technologies. A multi-media campaign, \\n“Swabhimaan”, has been launched to inform, educate and motivate people to \\nopen bank accounts. During this year, banks will cover 20,000 villages. \\nRemaining will be covered during 2011-12. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n19 \\n\\nUnorganised sector \\n\\n106. I had announced a co-contributory pension scheme “Swavalamban” in \\nthe Budget 2010-11. This scheme has been welcomed by the workers in \\nunorganised sector. Over 4 lakh applications have already been received. On the \\nbasis of the feedback received, I am relaxing the exit norms whereby a subscriber \\nunder Swavalamban will be allowed exit at the age of 50 years instead of 60 \\nyears, or a minimum tenure of 20 years, whichever is later. I also propose to \\nextend the benefit of Government contribution from three to five years for all \\nsubscribers of Swavalamban who enroll during 2010-11 and 2011-12. An \\nestimated 20 lakh beneficiaries will join the scheme by March 2012. \\n107. Under the on-going Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme \\nfor BPL beneficiaries, the eligibility for pension is proposed to be reduced \\nfrom 65 years at present to 60 years. Further, for those who are 80 years and \\nabove, the pension amount is being raised from ` 200 at present to ` 500 per \\nmonth. \\nEnvironment and Climate Change \\n\\nForests \\n\\n108. Protection and regeneration of forests has great ecological, economic \\nand social value. Our Government has launched an ambitious ten-year Green \\nIndia mission. I propose to allocate `200 crore from the National Clean Energy \\nFund to begin its implementation in 2011-12. \\nEnvironmental Management \\n\\n109. Environmental pollution has emerged as a serious public health concern \\nacross the country. I propose to allocate `200 crore from the National Clean \\nEnergy Fund as Centre\\'s contribution in 2011-12 for launching environmental \\nremediation programmes. \\nCleaning of Rivers and Lakes \\n\\n110. A number of projects under the National Ganga River Basin Authority \\nhave been approved in 2010-11. This momentum will be further stepped up. \\nThere are many rivers and lakes of cultural and historical significance that need \\nto be cleaned. In the course of the year 2011-12, I propose to provide a special \\nallocation of `200 crore for the clean-up of some important lakes and rivers \\nother than the Ganga. \\nSome Other Initiatives \\n\\n111. In order to boost development in the North Eastern Region and Special \\nCategory States, the allocation for special assistance has been almost doubled to \\n`8,000 crore for 2011-12. Out of this, `5,400 crore has been allocated as untied \\nSpecial Central Assistance. \\n112. The Government’s special support to Jammu & Kashmir is anchored in \\n`28,000 crore Prime Minister\\'s Reconstruction Plan. In addition, for the current \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n20 \\n\\nyear, about `8,000 crore has been provided for the State\\'s development needs. A \\nTask Force to assess infrastructure needs that can be addressed within a time \\nhorizon of 24 months for Ladakh and Jammu regions of the State has \\nrecommended projects amounting to `416 crore and `497 crore, respectively. I \\nam providing `100 crore for Ladakh and `150 crore for Jammu for these identified \\nprojects in 2011-12. \\n\\n113. To give a boost to the development of backward regions, the allocation \\nunder the Backward Regions Grant Fund has been increased from `7,300 crore \\nto `9,890 crore amounting to an increase of over 35 per cent. \\n114. To address problems related to Left Wing Extremism affected districts, \\nan Integrated Action Plan (IAP) for 60 selected tribal and backward districts \\nhas been launched in December 2010. The scheme is being implemented with \\n100 per cent block grant of `25 crore and `30 crore per district during the \\nyears 2010-11 and 2011-12, respectively. The allocated funds are placed at the \\ndisposal of the district level committees who in consultation with local MPs \\nwill have the flexibility to spend the amount on development schemes as per \\nthe local needs. \\n115. In recognition of the sacrifices made by Central Para-military Forces \\nengaged in tackling Left Wing Extremism, a lump sum ex-gratia compensation \\nof `9 lakh for 100 per cent disability will now be granted to personnel of the \\nDefence and para-military forces who are discharged from service on medical \\ngrounds on account of disability attributable to or aggravated in government \\nservice. For personnel with disability ranging from 20 to 99 per cent, a \\nproportionate amount would be given. \\n116. In the Budget 2011-12, a provision of `1,64,415 crore has been made \\nfor Defence services which include `69,199 crore for capital expenditure. \\nNeedless to say, any further requirement for the country\\'s defence would \\nbe met. \\n117. In order to speed up delivery of justice, the Plan provision for \\nDepartment of Justice for 2011-12 has been increased three-fold to `1,000 \\ncrore. The enhanced provision will help in building judicial infrastructure and \\nthe project on E-courts. \\nCensus 2011 \\n\\n118. The 15th Census in the country is being conducted from 9th February. It \\nis the largest administrative exercise in the country providing statistical data on \\ndifferent socio-economic parameters of population. \\n119. In response to the overwhelming demand for enumeration of castes other \\nthan Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Census 2011, it has been decided \\nto canvass ‘caste’ as a separate time bound exercise. This exercise will start in \\nJune 2011 and will be completed by 30th September 2011. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n21 \\n\\nIV. Improving Governance \\nI now turn to some important measures being taken for improving \\ngovernance. \\n\\nUID Mission \\n\\n120. The UID Mission has taken off and Aadhaar numbers are being generated \\nin large numbers. So far 20 lakh Aadhaar numbers have been given and from 1st \\nOctober 2011, ten lakh numbers will be generated per day. The stage is now set \\nfor realising the potential of Aadhaar for improving service delivery, accountability \\nand transparency in governance of various schemes. \\nIT Initiatives \\n\\n121. The backbone of an efficient tax administration is a robust IT infrastructure \\nand its deployment for enhanced taxpayer services. Towards this objective, both \\nthe Central Boards of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and Excise and Customs (CBEC) \\nhave put in place the following measures: \\n• The on-line preparation and e-filing of income tax returns, \\ne-payment of taxes through 32 agency banks, ECS facility for \\nelectronic clearing of refunds directly in taxpayers’ bank accounts \\nand electronic filing of TDS returns are now available throughout \\nthe country. These measures have empowered taxpayers to meet \\ntheir tax obligations without visiting an income tax office. \\n\\n• The Centralized Processing Centre (CPC) at Bengaluru has \\nincreased its daily processing capacity from 20,000 to 1.5 lakh \\nreturns in 2010-11. This project has won a Gold Award for \\ne-Governance in 2011. Two more CPCs will become operational \\nin Manesar and Pune by May 2011 and a fourth CPC will come up \\nin Kolkata in 2011-12. \\n\\n• With the completion of its IT Consolidation Project, CBEC can \\nnow centrally host its key applications in Customs, Central Excise \\nand Service Tax. The Customs EDI system now covers 92 locations \\nacross the country. CBEC\\'s e-Commerce portal ICEGATE, has \\nalso been conferred a Gold Award for e-Governance. \\n\\n• The \\'Sevottam\\' concept has been adopted by both Boards. The three \\npilot projects of Aaykar Seva Kendras (ASKs) under CBDT have \\ncome of age. CBDT will commission eight more such centres this \\nyear. In 2011-12, another fifty ASKs will be set up across the \\ncountry. CBEC has also launched a similar initiative and four of \\ntheir pilot projects have been commissioned. \\n\\n• The electronic filing of Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) statements \\nhas stabilized. The Board shall soon notify a category of salaried \\ntaxpayers who will not be required to file a return of income as \\n\\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n22 \\n\\ntheir tax liability has been discharged by their employer through \\n\\ndeduction at source. \\n\\n• CBDT will provide a separate web-based facility to enable a direct, \\nstand-alone interface for taxpayers with the Income Tax Department \\nso that they can report and track the resolution of their refunds and \\ncredit for prepaid taxes. \\n\\n122. Mission Mode Projects for computerization of Commercial Taxes in \\nStates that I announced in my last Budget, will allow States to align with the \\nroll out of GST. Funds have been released for 31 projects received from the \\nStates and Union Territories. Most of the States and UTs have already enabled \\nthe facility of dealers making electronic payments. A number of States have \\nalready started accepting Electronic Tax Returns and issuing forms required \\nfor inter-state trade. \\n123. With the development of the economy, the need to review the provisions \\nof the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 has been felt over the years. I propose to introduce \\na Bill shortly to amend the Indian Stamp Act. \\n124. Five years ago, we took an initiative to introduce a modern and people-\\nfriendly e-stamping facility in the country. Only six States have introduced this \\nsystem so far. I propose to launch a new scheme with an outlay of `300 crore to \\nprovide assistance to States to modernise their stamp and registration \\nadministration and roll out e-stamping in all the districts in the next three years. \\n125. I propose to introduce a new simplified return form \\'Sugam\\' to reduce \\nthe compliance burden of small taxpayers who fall within the scope of \\npresumptive taxation. \\n126. The increase in scope of cases admitted by the Settlement Commissions \\nhas provided relief to several taxpayers. This has also increased the workload of \\nthe Commission. To fast track the disposal of cases, three more Benches of the \\nCommission are being set up. \\n127. Substantial amounts of revenue in both direct and indirect taxes, remain \\nlocked up in appeals at different levels. Both Boards also invest substantial effort \\nand money in litigation with their employees. In keeping with the National \\nLitigation Policy, several steps have been initiated in 2010-11 for reducing \\nlitigation and focusing attention on high revenue cases. Instructions have been \\nissued raising limit of tax effects below which, tax disputes will not be pursued \\nby Government in higher Courts of Appeal. These measures would enhance \\nproductivity of resources employed in raising revenue. \\nCorruption \\n\\n128. A Group of Ministers has been constituted to consider measures for \\ntackling corruption. The Group has been tasked with addressing issues relating \\nto State funding of elections, speedier processing of corruption cases of public \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n23 \\n\\nservants, transparency in public procurement and contracts, discretionary powers \\nof Central ministers and competitive system for exploiting natural resources. \\nThe Group will make its recommendations in a time bound manner. \\n\\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation System \\n\\n129. Pursuant to the recommendations of Second Administrative Reforms \\nCommission, the Government has set up a Performance Monitoring and \\nEvaluation System (PMES) to assess the effectiveness of Government \\ndepartments in their mandated functions. It involves preparation of a Results \\nFramework Document (RFD) by each department, highlighting its objectives \\nand priorities for the financial year and achievements against pre-specified \\ntargets at the end of the year. This document would be available for public \\ninformation on the departmental websites. In the first phase, 62 departments \\nhave been covered under PMES. \\nTAGUP \\n\\n130. In pursuance of the announcement made in the Budget 2010-11, I had \\nset up a Technology Advisory Group for Unique Projects (TAGUP). The Group \\nhas submitted its report and its recommendations have been accepted in \\nprinciple. The modalities of implementation are being worked out. \\n131. Indian Rupee now has a new symbol which has been notified for use by \\nthe Central and State Governments, business entities and the general public. A \\nnew series of coins carrying this symbol will be issued shortly. The Government \\nhas approached Unicode Standards Authority for inclusion of the symbol in \\ninternational standards. \\nV. Budget Estimates 2011-12 \\nI now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2011-12. \\n\\n132. The Gross Tax Receipts are estimated at `9,32,440 crore which is an \\nincrease of 24.9 per cent over the Budget Estimates for 2010-11. After \\ndevolution to States, the net tax to Centre in 2011-12 is `6,64,457 crore. The \\nNon Tax Revenue Receipts for 2011-12 are estimated at `1,25,435 crore. \\n133. The total expenditure proposed for 2011-12 is `12,57,729 crore, which \\nis an increase of 13.4 per cent over the Budget Estimates for 2010-11. The \\nPlan Expenditure at `4,41,547 crore marks an increase of 18.3 per cent and the \\nNon Plan Expenditure at `8,16,182 crore is an increase of 10.9 per cent over \\nBE 2010-11. As 2011-12 is the last year of the Eleventh Plan, I am happy to \\nshare that Eleventh Plan expenditure in nominal terms is more than 100 per \\ncent of the expenditure envisaged for the Plan period. \\n134. The total plan and non-plan transfers of `2,01,733 crore to States and UT \\nGovernments in 2011-12 have increased by 23 per cent over the Budget Estimates \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n24 \\n\\n2010-11. This includes grants of `13,713 crore in 2011-12 to local bodies as per \\nthe recommendation of the Thirteenth Finance Commission. \\n\\n135. Hon\\'ble Members are aware that in the course of 2010-11, I had the \\nopportunity to effect a further improvement in the fiscal balance, due to the \\nhigher than anticipated non-tax revenues from 3G spectrum auctions. I chose \\nto do that and much more. While I provided additional resources of about \\n`50,000 crore to critical infrastructure and social sectors and also to meet the \\nexpenditure on subsidies, I have brought down the fiscal deficit from 5.5 per \\ncent to 5.1 per cent of the GDP for 2010-11. For 2011-12, I have kept it at 4.6 \\nper cent of GDP, which improves upon my own target for 2011-12 indicated in \\nthe fiscal road map presented in the last Budget. In the Medium Term Fiscal \\nPolicy Statement being presented to the House today, the rolling targets for \\nfiscal deficit are placed at 4.1 per cent for 2012-13, and 3.5 per cent for \\n2013-14. \\n136. There has been some concern expressed regarding the stickiness of \\nGovernment\\'s revenue deficit in the post-global crisis phase of the economy. \\nFor 2010-11 as against a target of 4 per cent, the revenue deficit is estimated at \\n3.4 per cent of GDP. In the past few years the transfers to States and other \\ndevelopmental expenditure have grown significantly. These are classified as \\nrevenue expenditure even though a considerable part of the expenditure from \\nthese transfers is in the nature of capital expenditure. In 2010-11, `90,792 \\ncrore from such revenue expenditures were in the nature of capital expenditure. \\nSimilarly, in 2011-12 grants-in-aid for creation of capital assets, which are \\nnow shown separately in the Budget documents, are about `1.47 lakh crore. \\nTaking these budget provisions into account, the “effective revenue deficit” is \\nestimated at 2.3 per cent in the Revised Estimates for 2010-11 and 1.8 per cent \\nfor 2011-12. \\n137. In my last Budget, I had stated that Government would avoid issuing \\nbonds in lieu of subsidies to oil and fertiliser companies. I have adhered to this \\ndecision, thereby bringing all subsidy related liabilities into our fiscal \\naccounting. \\n138. The fiscal deficit of 4.6 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 works out to \\n`4,12,817 crore. Taking into account the various other financing items for \\nfiscal deficit, the net market borrowing of the Government in 2011-12 would \\nbe `3.43 lakh crore. In addition, `15,000 crore is proposed to be financed \\nthrough Treasury Bills. Accordingly, the Central Government debt as a \\nproportion of GDP is estimated at 44.2 per cent for 2011-12 as against 52.5 per \\ncent recommended by the Thirteenth Finance Commission. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n25 \\n\\nPART -B \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\nI shall now present my tax proposals. \\n\\n139. In the formulation of these proposals, my priorities are directed towards \\nmaking taxes moderate, payments simple for the taxpayer and collection of \\ntaxes easy for the tax collector. \\nVI. Direct Taxes \\nI shall now deal with direct taxes. \\n\\n140. As Government\\'s policy on direct taxes has been outlined in the DTC, \\nwhich is before Parliament, I have limited my proposals to initiatives that require \\nurgent attention. \\n141. Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by broadening the \\ntax slabs. To take us closer to DTC rates, I propose to enhance the exemption \\nlimit for the general category of individual taxpayers from `1,60,000 to \\n`1,80,000 this year. This measure will provide a uniform tax relief of `2,000 \\nto every taxpayer of this category. \\n142. Senior citizens deserve our special attention. For them, I propose \\n• to reduce the qualifying age, from 65 years to 60 years; \\n• to enhance the exemption limit from `2,40,000 to `2,50,000; \\n• To create a new category of Very Senior Citizens, eighty years \\nand above, who will be eligible for a higher exemption limit of \\n`5,00,000. \\n\\n143. In the case of corporates, my initiative of phasing out the surcharge \\ncontinues. I propose to reduce the current surcharge of 7.5 per cent on domestic \\ncompanies to 5 per cent. Simultaneously, I propose to increase the rate of \\nMinimum Alternate Tax (MAT) from the current rate of 18 per cent to 18.5 per \\ncent of book profits to keep the effective rate of the MAT at the same level. As \\na measure to ensure equal sharing of the corporate tax liability, I propose to \\nlevy MAT on developers of Special Economic Zones as well as units operating \\nin SEZs. \\n144. To attract foreign funds for financing of infrastructure, I propose to: \\n• create special vehicles in the form of notified infrastructure debt \\nfunds; \\n\\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26 \\n\\n• subject interest payment on the borrowings of these funds to a \\nreduced withholding tax rate of 5 per cent instead of the current \\nrate of 20 per cent; \\n\\n• exempt the income of the fund from tax. \\n\\n145. In order to promote savings and raise funds for infrastructure, an additional \\ndeduction of `20,000 for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds was \\nnotified by the Central Government in 2010-11. I propose to extend this window \\nfor one more year. \\n146. It has been represented that the taxation of foreign dividends in the \\nhands of resident taxpayers at full rate is a disincentive for their repatriation to \\nIndia and they continue to remain invested abroad. For the year 2011-12, I \\npropose a lower rate of 15 per cent tax on dividends received by an Indian \\ncompany from its foreign subsidiary. I do hope these funds will now flow \\nto India. \\n147. In order to give a boost to production in the agriculture sector, I propose \\nto extend the benefit of investment linked deduction to businesses engaged in \\nthe production of fertilisers. \\n148. Considering the importance of housing, I also propose investment linked \\ndeduction to businesses which develop affordable housing under a notified \\nscheme. \\n149. In this Decade of Innovation, I enhanced the weighted deduction on \\npayments made to National Laboratories, universities and Institutes of technology, \\nfor scientific research, to 175 per cent in the last budget. I propose to further \\nenhance this to 200 per cent. \\n150. In order to strengthen our system of collection of information from foreign \\ntax jurisdictions, I propose to provide a toolbox of counter measures to discourage \\ntransactions with entities located in non-cooperative jurisdictions as may be \\nnotified by the Government. \\n151. My proposals on direct taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue loss \\nof `11,500 crore for the year. \\nVII. Indirect Taxes \\nI shall now turn to my indirect tax proposals. \\n\\n152. In view of the healthy growth in indirect taxes in 2010-11, I had the \\noption to roll back the Central excise duty to levels prevailing in November \\n2008. I have chosen not to do so for two reasons. I would like to see improved \\nbusiness margins translated into higher investment rates. I would also like to \\nstay my course towards GST. I have therefore decided to maintain the standard \\nrate of Central excise duty at 10 per cent. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n27 \\n\\n153. I propose certain changes in the Central Excise rate structure to prepare \\nthe ground for the transition to GST, beginning with a reduction in the number \\nof exemptions. At present, there are about 100 items that are exempt from Central \\nExcise as well as State VAT. In addition, there are as many as 370 items that \\nenjoy exemption from Central Excise duty but are chargeable to VAT. I propose \\nto withdraw the exemption on 130 of these items that are mainly in the nature of \\nconsumer goods. The remaining 240 items would be brought into the tax net \\nwhen GST is introduced. \\n154. A nominal Central Excise duty of 1 per cent is being imposed on the 130 \\nitems that are entering the tax net. No Cenvat credit would be available for the \\nmanufacture of these items. Basic food and fuel would continue to be exempt. \\nThis levy would also not apply to precious metals and stones. In case of jewellery \\nand articles of gold, silver and precious metals, the levy would apply only to \\ngoods sold under a brand name. \\n155. Most of the States have increased their merit rate of VAT from 4 per cent \\nto 5 per cent. In line with this, I also propose to enhance the lower rate of Central \\nExcise duty from 4 per cent to 5 per cent. \\n156. Ready-made garments and made-ups of textiles are currently under an \\noptional excise duty regime. A manufacturer is required to pay duty only if he \\nwishes to avail of Cenvat credit. Our garment and made-ups industry has come \\nof age and has shown handsome growth in recent years. As part of base expansion, \\nI propose to convert the optional levy into a mandatory levy at a unified rate of \\n10 per cent. The levy would however, apply only to branded garments or made-\\nups and not to those tailored or made to order for a retail customer. Credit of tax \\npaid on inputs, capital goods and input services would be available to \\nmanufacturers of these products. Keeping in mind the fragmented nature of this \\nindustry, full SSI exemption is also being extended to these products. Export of \\nthese items would continue to be zero-rated. \\n157. We have a long term commitment to align our customs duty rates to \\nthose prevailing in ASEAN countries. The peak rate of customs duty has \\nbeen reduced over the years and has settled at 10 per cent. In view of \\ncontinued uncertainties in the global economy, I propose to hold the peak \\nrate at its current level. However, some rationalization is being done to unify \\nthree rates namely, 2 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent at the middle level \\nof 2.5 per cent. \\n158. I now turn to proposals that are aimed at encouraging some of the thrust \\nsectors that are in need of attention. \\nAgriculture & Related Sectors \\n\\n159. Hon\\'ble Members would recall that, in the last Budget, I had announced \\na package of measures to improve the availability of storage and warehouse \\nfacilities for agricultural produce as well as to incentivize food processing. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n28 \\n\\nI have received encouraging feedback on the impact of these measures. I propose \\nto enlarge the scope of these exemptions by: \\n\\n• extending full exemption from excise duty to air-conditioning \\nequipment and refrigeration panels for cold chain infrastructure; \\n• including conveyor belts in the full exemption from excise duty to \\nequipment used in cold storages, mandis and warehouses. \\n\\n160. A concessional rate of basic customs duty of 5 per cent was provided to \\nspecified agricultural machinery in the last budget. This duty is being reduced \\nfurther to 2.5 per cent and the concession is also being extended to parts of such \\nmachinery to encourage their domestic production. \\n161. Micro-irrigation is an environment-friendly and efficient means of \\nirrigation especially for dry land farming. I propose to reduce the basic customs \\nduty on micro-irrigation equipment from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent. \\n162. De-oiled rice bran cake constitutes an important ingredient of cattle feed \\nand its improved availability would have a positive impact on milk production. \\nI propose to provide full exemption from basic customs duty to this item. \\nSimultaneously, an export duty of 10 per cent would be levied to discourage its \\nexport. \\nManufacturing Sector \\n\\n163. For the manufacturing sector, my proposals seek to encourage domestic \\nvalue addition vis-a-vis imports, to remove duty inversions and anomalies and \\nto provide a level playing field to the domestic industry. The major proposals \\nare to: \\n• reduce basic customs duty on raw silk (not thrown) from 30 to 5 \\nper cent; \\n\\n• reduce basic customs duty from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent on certain \\ntextile intermediates and inputs for chemicals, ferro-alloys and \\npaper; \\n\\n• reduce basic customs duty on certain specified inputs for \\nmanufacture of certain technical fibre and yarn from 7.5 per cent \\nto 5 per cent; \\n\\n• fully exempt stainless steel scrap from basic customs duty; \\n• reduce import duties on specified raw material for the manufacture \\nof syringes and needles to 5 per cent basic and 4 per cent CVD; \\n• extend the concession available to parts, components and \\naccessories for manufacture of mobile handsets till 31st March, \\n2012 and to include few more items in its ambit; \\n\\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n29 \\n\\n• expand the raw material list for manufacture of specified electronic \\ncomponents that are fully exempt from basic customs duty; \\n• reduce excise duty (and hence CVD) on parts of ink-jet and laser-\\njet printers from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. \\n\\n164. Iron ore attracts an export duty of 15 per cent in the case of lumps and 5 \\nper cent in the case of fines. This is a natural resource which needs to be conserved. \\nI propose to enhance the rate of export duty for all types of iron ore and unify it \\nat 20 per cent ad valorem. Iron ore is also exported in a value-added, pelletized \\nform. Full exemption from export duty is being provided to iron ore pellets to \\nencourage the value addition process for fines. \\n165. As a measure of relief to cement industry, I propose to replace the existing \\nexcise duty rates with composite rates having an ad valorem and specific \\ncomponent with some rationalization. The basic customs duty on two critical \\nraw materials of this industry viz. petcoke and gypsum is proposed to be reduced \\nto 2.5 per cent. \\n166. To drive the financial inclusion agenda of the Government, I propose to \\nfully exempt cash dispensers from basic customs duty. Full exemption is also \\nbeing extended to parts of such machines to encourage their domestic production. \\nEnvironment \\n\\n167. Full exemption from basic customs duty and a concessional rate of Central \\nExcise duty of 4 per cent was provided to specified parts of electrical vehicles in \\nthe last Budget on actual-user basis. I propose to extend the concession to batteries \\nimported by such manufacturers for the replacement market. \\n168. Fuel cell or Hydrogen cell technology is a promising green technology \\nfor the automobile sector. I propose to extend the concessional excise duty of 10 \\nper cent to vehicles based on this technology. \\n169. Hybrid vehicles enjoy a concessional excise duty rate of 10 per cent. \\nHowever, import dependence for their critical parts/ sub-assemblies is still quite \\nhigh. It is proposed to grant specified parts of such vehicles full exemption from \\nbasic customs duty and special CVD. In addition, a concessional rate of excise \\nduty of 5 per cent is being prescribed to incentivise their domestic production. \\n170. In response to the growing demand for green products, a technology has \\nbeen developed indigenously for the conversion of fossil fuel vehicles into Hybrid \\nvehicles through the fitment of a kit. I propose to reduce the excise duty on such \\nkits and their parts from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. \\n171. In the last Budget, Central Excise duty on LED lights was reduced from \\n8 per cent to 4 per cent to promote their use. The basic component of these lights \\nviz. the LED attracts an excise duty (hence, CVD) of 10 per cent and a special \\nCVD of 4 per cent. The excise duty on LEDs is being reduced to 5 per cent and \\nspecial CVD is being fully exempted. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n30 \\n\\n172. The solar lantern enables our countrymen in far-flung villages to partake \\nof developments in green technology. The basic customs duty on such lanterns \\nis being reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. Basic customs duty on a few \\nmore inputs used in the manufacture of solar modules/ cells is being reduced \\nto Nil. \\n173. Environmental considerations demand promotion of laundry soaps which \\nconserve water and are gentle on the soil. To this end, full exemption from basic \\ncustoms duty is being provided to Crude Palm Stearin for use in the manufacture \\nof laundry soap. \\n174. Pre-tanning or tanning processes in the leather industry use chemicals \\nwhich are pollutants. To encourage use of green processes, full exemption from \\nbasic excise duty is being granted to enzyme based preparations for pre-tanning. \\nInfrastructure \\n\\n175. Capital goods imported for the expansion of existing mega or ultra mega \\npower projects enjoy a concessional basic customs duty of 2.5 per cent and full \\nexemption from CVD. This creates a disability for the domestic suppliers who \\nare required to pay Central Excise duty on supplies to such projects. I propose to \\ncorrect this anomaly by providing a parallel excise duty exemption. \\n176. Bio-based asphalt is an emerging, green technology for the surfacing of \\nroads. Full exemption from basic customs duty is being extended to bio-asphalt \\nand specified machinery for its application in the construction of national \\nhighways. Tunnel-boring machines required for the construction of highways \\nare also being included in this exemption. \\nOther Proposals \\n\\n177. Works of art and antiquities are exempt from customs duties when \\nimported for exhibition in a public museum or national institution. In recent \\nyears, many organisations have joined the cause of promoting and popularising \\nboth traditional and contemporary art. Some of them have been active in locating \\nheritage works of Indian art and antiquities in foreign countries and bringing \\nthem back home. To encourage such initiatives, I propose to expand the scope of \\nthis exemption for works of art and antiquities to also apply to imports for \\nexhibition or display, in private art galleries or similar premises that are open to \\nthe general public. Department of Culture will notify details of the scheme \\nseparately. \\n178. Full exemption from import duty is available to spares and capital goods \\nrequired for ship-repair units. This exemption is being extended to imports by \\nship owners too. \\n179. The concessional basic customs duty of 5 per cent and CVD of 5 per \\ncent, presently applicable to high-speed printing presses imported by newspaper \\nestablishments is being extended to mailroom equipment. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31 \\n\\n180. The Indian film industry has represented that colour, unexposed jumbo \\nrolls of cinematographic film are not manufactured domestically and have to \\nbe imported. I propose to exempt jumbo rolls of 400 feet and 1000 feet from \\nCVD by providing full exemption from excise duty. \\n181. I propose to provide outright concession to factory-built ambulances in \\nplace of the existing refund-based concession from excise duty. A refund-based \\nconcession is available to taxis having a seating capacity not exceeding 7 \\npersons including the driver. I propose to extend this to vehicles upto a seating \\ncapacity not exceeding 13 persons including the driver. \\n182. Some of the other relief measures that I propose are: \\n• Reduction in basic customs duty on raw pistachio from 30 per \\ncent to 10 per cent; \\n• Reduction in basic customs duty on bamboo for agarbatti from \\n30 per cent to 10 per cent; \\n• Reduction in basic customs duty on lactose for the manufacture \\nof homeopathic medicines from 25 per cent to 10 per cent; and \\n• Reduction in central excise duty on sanitary napkins, baby and \\nadult diapers from 10 per cent to 1 per cent. \\n\\n183. My proposals relating to customs and Central excise are estimated to \\nresult in a net revenue gain of `7,300 crore for the year. \\nVIII. Service Tax \\n184. The actual collections of Service Tax do not reflect the full potential of \\nthis sector. While retaining the standard rate of service tax at 10 per cent, I \\nseek to achieve a closer fit between the present service tax regime and its GST \\nsuccessor by: \\n• Bringing in a few new services into the tax net to expand the tax \\nbase while ensuring that the impact is predominantly on sections \\nof society that have the ability to pay; \\n\\n• Suitably expanding or rationalizing the scope of existing service \\ncategories; \\n\\n• Rationalizing certain provisions relating to import of services and \\nvaluation; \\n\\n• Modifying provisions of the Cenvat Credit scheme to achieve a \\nmore realistic balance between input credits and output tax and \\nharmonising the provisions of the scheme across goods and \\nservices; \\n\\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32 \\n\\n• Rationalizing penal provisions to reinforce the message that honest \\ntaxpayers would be facilitated and deviants would be dealt with \\nseverely; and \\n\\n• Adoption of Point of Taxation rules for services which would shift \\nthe basis for tax collection from “cash” towards “accrual” basis as \\nwith Central Excise duty. \\n\\n185. I propose to levy service tax on the following new services: \\n• Hotel accommodation, in excess of declared tariff of `1,000 per \\nday with an abatement of 50 per cent so that the effective burden is \\nonly 5 per cent of the amount charged; \\n\\n• Service provided by air-conditioned restaurants that have license \\nto serve liquor, by giving an abatement of 70 per cent. Thus, the \\neffective burden will be 3 per cent of the bill. \\n\\n186. I imposed service tax in 2010-11 on health check up or treatment. This \\nlevy has resulted in differential treatment between persons who make payments \\nthemselves and others where payments are made by an insurance company or a \\nbusiness entity. Thus, I propose to replace it with a tax on all services provided \\nby hospitals with 25 or more beds that have the facility of central air-conditioning. \\nThough the tax is on high- end treatment, I propose to sweeten the pill by an \\nabatement of 50 per cent so that the actual burden is kept at 5 per cent of the \\nvalue of service. I also propose to extend the levy to diagnostic tests of all kinds \\nwith the same rate of abatement. However, all Government hospitals shall be \\noutside this levy. \\n187. I propose to raise the service tax on air travel by `50 in the case of domestic \\nair travel and `250 on international journeys by economy class. I also propose to \\ntax travel by higher classes on domestic sector at the standard rate of 10 per cent \\nto bring it on par with journeys by higher classes on international air travel. \\n188. Services provided by life insurance companies in the area of investment \\nare also proposed to be brought into tax net on the same lines as ULIPs. I propose \\nto expand the scope of legal services to include services provided by business \\nentities to individuals as well as representational and arbitration services by \\nindividuals to business entities. There shall, however, be no tax on services \\nprovided by individuals to other individuals. \\n189. There are certain other changes mainly by way of rationalisation or \\nexpansion in the scope of certain services or by plugging existing loopholes. I do \\nnot wish to take the valuable time of the House in further elaboration here. \\n190. The strength of a good value-added-tax lies in the free flow of the credit \\nof the tax paid at the previous stage. Due to complexities, there have been many \\nlegal disputes on the availability of credit on a number of inputs or input services. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33 \\n\\nThese provisions are being rationalized by laying down clear definitions so that \\nthe scope of inputs and input services that are eligible and those that are not, is \\nclear. Allocation of CENVAT credit to exempt and taxable goods and services is \\nalso being streamlined. \\n\\n191. The number of assessees in service tax has grown manifold. I find that a \\nlarge number of them comprise individuals or sole proprietors with small \\nturnovers. Any audit at their premises tends to dislocate their activities for the \\nduration of the audit. I therefore, propose to free all individual and sole proprietor \\ntaxpayers with a turnover upto `60 lakh from the formalities of audit. This will \\ngive relief to a large number of taxpayers. I also intend to give all assessees with \\nturnover upto `60 lakh, the benefit of 3 percentage points in interest on delayed \\npayment. \\n192. In keeping with our thrust to encourage voluntary compliance, the penal \\nprovisions for Service Tax are being rationalised. A key component of this strategy \\nwould be to treat less harshly those who have maintained truthful records but \\nhave fallen short of discharging their tax liability. Simultaneously, deliberate \\nevaders with unrecorded business transactions will be dealt with more severely. \\nSimilar changes are being carried out in Central Excise and Customs laws. The \\ndetails of the provisions are in the Finance Bill. \\n193. My proposals relating to service tax are estimated to result in net revenue \\ngain of `4,000 crore for the year. \\n194. Many experts have argued that it will be desirable to tax services based \\non a small negative list, so that many untapped sectors are brought into the tax \\nnet. Such an approach will be very conducive for a nationwide GST. I propose to \\ninitiate an informed public debate on the subject to help us finalise the approach \\nto GST. \\n195. Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in Customs, Central \\nExcise and Service Tax will be laid on the Table of the House in due course. \\n196. My proposals on direct taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of \\n`11,500 crore for the year. Proposals relating to indirect taxes are estimated to \\nresult in a net revenue gain of `11,300 crore, leaving a net loss of `200 crore in \\nthe Budget. \\n197. As an emerging economy, with a voice on the global stage, India stands \\nat the threshold of a decade which presents immense possibilities. We must not \\nlet the recent strains and tensions hold us back from converting these possibilities \\ninto realities. With oneness of heart, let us all build an India, which in not too \\ndistant a future, will enter the comity of developed nations. \\nMadam Speaker, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House. \\n\\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in', 'Budget 2012-2013 \\n\\nSpeech of \\n\\nPranab Mukherjee \\n\\nMinister of Finance \\n\\nMarch 16, 2012 \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\nI rise to present the Union Budget for 2012-13. \\n\\nFor the Indian economy, this was a year of recovery interrupted. When \\none year ago, I rose to present the Budget, the challenges were many, but there \\nwas a sense that the world economy was on the mend. The Budget was presented \\nin the first glimmer of hope. But reality turned out to be different. The sovereign \\ndebt crisis in the Euro zone intensified, political turmoil in Middle East injected \\nwidespread uncertainty, crude oil prices rose, an earthquake struck Japan and \\nthe overall gloom refused to lift. \\n\\n2. While I believe that there should be no room for complacency, nor any \\nexcuse for what happens in one’s own country, we will be misled if we ignore \\nthe ground realities of the world. The global crisis has affected us. India’s Gross \\nDomestic Product (GDP) is estimated to grow by 6.9 per cent in 2011-12, after \\nhaving grown at the rate of 8.4 per cent in each of the two preceding years. \\nThough we have been able to limit the adverse impact of this slowdown on our \\neconomy, this year’s performance has been disappointing. But it is also a fact \\nthat in any cross-country comparison, India still remains among the front runners \\nin economic growth. \\n3. For the better part of the past two years, we had to battle near double-\\ndigit headline inflation. Our monetary and fiscal policy response during this \\nperiod was geared towards taming domestic inflationary pressures. A tight \\nmonetary policy impacted investment and consumption growth. The fiscal policy \\nhad to absorb expanded outlays on subsidies and duty reductions to limit the \\npass-through of higher fuel prices to consumers. As a result growth moderated \\nand the fiscal balance deteriorated. \\n4. But there is good news in the detail. With agriculture and services \\ncontinuing to perform well, India’s slowdown can be attributed almost entirely \\nto weak industrial growth. While we do not have aggregate figures for the last \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n2 \\n\\nquarter of 2011-12, numerous indicators pertaining to this period suggest that \\nthe economy is now turning around. There are signs of recovery in coal, \\nfertilisers, cement and electricity sectors. These are core sectors that have an \\nimpact on the entire economy. Indian manufacturing appears to be on the cusp \\nof a revival. \\n\\n5. We are now at a juncture when it is necessary to take hard decisions. We \\nhave to improve our macroeconomic environment and strengthen domestic \\ngrowth drivers to sustain high growth in the medium term. We have to accelerate \\nthe pace of reforms and improve supply side management of the economy. \\n6. We are about to enter the first year of the Twelfth Five Year Plan which \\naims at “faster, sustainable and more inclusive growth.” The Plan will be launched \\nwith the Budget proposals for 2012-13. In keeping with the stated priorities, I \\nhave identified five objectives that we must address effectively in the ensuing \\nfiscal year. These are: \\n• Focus on domestic demand driven growth recovery; \\n• Create conditions for rapid revival of high growth in private \\ninvestment; \\n• Address supply bottlenecks in agriculture, energy and transport \\nsectors, particularly in coal, power, national highways, railways \\nand civil aviation; \\n• Intervene decisively to address the problem of malnutrition \\nespecially in the 200 high-burden districts; and \\n• Expedite coordinated implementation of decisions being taken \\nto improve delivery systems, governance, and transparency; and \\naddress the problem of black money and corruption in public \\nlife. \\n7. Today, India has global responsibilities of a kind that it did not have \\nearlier. Our presence at the high table of global economic policy makers is a \\nmatter of some satisfaction. It, however, places new responsibilities on our \\nshoulders. If India can continue to build on its economic strength, it can be a \\nsource of stability for the world economy and provide a safe destination for \\nrestless global capital. \\n8. I know that mere words are not enough. What we need is a credible \\nroadmap backed by a set of implementable proposals to meet those objectives. \\nIn my attempt to do so, I have benefited from the able guidance of Hon’ble \\nPrime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and strong support of the UPA Chairperson \\nSmt. Sonia Gandhi. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n3 \\n\\nI would now begin with a brief overview of the economy. \\n\\nOverview of the Economy \\n\\n9. Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey \\n2011-12, which gives a detailed analysis of the economy over the past 12 months. \\nIndia’s GDP is estimated to grow at 6.9 per cent in real terms in 2011-12. The \\ngrowth is estimated to be 2.5 per cent in agriculture, 3.9 per cent in industry and \\n9.4 per cent in services. There is a significant slowdown in comparison to the \\npreceding two years, primarily due to deceleration in industrial growth, more \\nspecifically in private investment. Rising cost of credit and weak domestic \\nbusiness sentiment, added to this decline. \\n10. The headline inflation remained high for most part of the year. It was \\nonly in December 2011 that it moderated to 8.3 per cent followed by 6.6 per cent \\nin January 2012. Monthly food inflation declined from 20.2 per cent in February \\n2010, to 9.4 per cent in March 2011 and turned negative in January 2012. Though \\nthe February 2012 inflation figure has gone up marginally, I expect the headline \\ninflation to moderate further in the next few months and remain stable thereafter. \\n11. India’s inflation is largely structural, driven predominantly by agricultural \\nsupply constraints and global cost push. Evidence suggests that prolonged periods \\nof high food inflation tend to get generalised. Fortunately, steps taken to bridge \\ngaps in distribution, storage and marketing systems to strengthen food supply \\nchains have helped us in a more effective management of inflation and led to a \\ndecline in food inflation. \\n12. The developments in India’s external trade in the first half of the current \\nyear were encouraging. During April-January 2011-12, exports grew by 23 per \\ncent to reach US Dollar 243 billion, while imports at US Dollar 391 billion \\nrecorded a growth of over 29 per cent. What is heartening is that India has \\nsuccessfully achieved diversification of export and import markets. The share of \\nAsia, including ASEAN, in total trade increased from 33.3 per cent in \\n2000-2001 to 57.3 per cent in the first half of 2011-12. This has helped us weather \\nthe impact of global crisis emanating from Europe and to a lesser extent from \\nUSA. \\n13. The current account deficit as a proportion of GDP for 2011-12 is likely \\nto be around 3.6 per cent. This, along with reduced net capital inflows in the \\nsecond and third quarters, put pressure on the exchange rate. \\n14. Taking a bird’s eye view of the entire economy and keeping in mind the \\ndifficult global environment, I expect India’s GDP growth in 2012-13 to be 7.6 \\nper cent, +/- 0.25 per cent. \\n15. I expect average inflation to be lower next year. I also expect the current \\naccount deficit to be smaller, aided by improvement in domestic financial savings. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n4 \\n\\nII. Growth \\nI now turn to growth and fiscal consolidation. \\n\\n16. Our fiscal balance has deteriorated in 2011-12 due to slippage in direct \\ntax revenue and increased subsidies. On both counts our underlying assumptions \\nat the time of Budget presentation last year were belied by subsequent \\ndevelopments. The profit margins came under pressure due to higher interest \\nrates and material costs. This impacted growth in corporate taxes. Further, as \\nagainst an assumption of US Dollar 90 a barrel, the average price of crude oil in \\n2011-12 is likely to exceed US Dollar 115. This has necessitated higher outlay \\non subsidies than projected. The continuing uncertainty in the global environment \\nmakes it necessary for us to strike a balance between fiscal consolidation and \\nstrengthening macroeconomic fundamentals to create adequate headroom to deal \\nwith future shocks. \\nFiscal Consolidation \\n\\nFRBM Act \\n\\n17. The implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management \\nAct, 2003 (FRBM Act) at Centre and the corresponding Acts at State level was \\nthe pivot in the successful consolidation of our fiscal balance prior to the global \\nfinancial crisis of 2008. The outbreak of the crisis coincided with the year when \\nthe mandated targets of 3 per cent fiscal deficit and elimination of revenue deficit \\nwere to be achieved. The Government had to deviate from these targets due to \\ninjection of fiscal stimulus at that time. Following my announcement in the last \\nBudget Speech, I am now introducing amendments to the FRBM Act as part of \\nFinance Bill, 2012. \\nExpenditure Reforms \\n\\n18. The fiscal targets for Centre under the amendments to the FRBM Act are \\nindicated in the Budget documents. Meanwhile, I would like to highlight two of \\nits features that are steps in the direction of expenditure reforms. First, the concept \\nof Effective Revenue Deficit, introduced in the last Budget, to address the \\nstructural imbalances in the revenue account, is being brought in as a fiscal \\nparameter. Effective Revenue Deficit is the difference between revenue deficit \\nand grants for creation of capital assets. Focusing on this will help in reducing \\nthe consumptive component of revenue deficit and create space for increased \\ncapital spending. \\n19. Second, a provision for “Medium-term Expenditure Framework \\nStatement” is being introduced in the Act. This statement shall set forth a three-\\nyear rolling target for expenditure indicators. It would help in undertaking a denovo \\nexercise for allocating resources for prioritised schemes and weeding out \\nothers that have outlived their utility. This would provide greater certainty in \\nmulti-year budgeting framework. It would also encourage efficiencies in \\nexpenditure management. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n5 \\n\\n20. In implementing the Twelfth Plan, the recommendations made by the \\nExpert Committees to streamline and reduce the number of Centrally Sponsored \\nSchemes and to address Plan and non-Plan classification, would be kept in \\nview. The Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System would be expanded to \\nfacilitate better tracking and utilisation of funds released by the Central \\nGovernment. \\nSubsidies \\n\\n21. Fiscal consolidation calls for efforts both to raise the tax-GDP ratio and \\nto lower the expenditure. In this context, we need to take a close look at the \\ngrowth of our revenue expenditure, particularly on subsidies. The major subsidies \\nat the Centre are for food, fertilisers and petroleum products. Some subsidies at \\nthis juncture in our development are inevitable. But they become undesirable if \\nthey compromise the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy, more so, \\nwhen they don’t reach the intended beneficiaries. \\n22. The Government has decided that from 2012-13 subsidies related to food \\nand for administering the Food Security Act will be fully provided for. All other \\nsubsidies would be funded to the extent that they can be borne by the economy \\nwithout any adverse implications. It would be my endeavour to restrict the \\nexpenditure on Central subsidies to under 2 per cent of GDP in 2012-13. Over \\nthe next three years, it would be further brought down to 1.75 per cent of GDP. \\nSuch a step is needed to improve the quality of public spending. Our effort now \\nwill be directed towards better targeting and leakage proof delivery of the \\nsubsidies. \\n23. The recommendations of the task force headed by Shri Nandan Nilekani \\non IT strategy for direct transfer of subsidy have been accepted. Based on these \\nrecommendations, a mobile- based Fertiliser Management System (mFMS) has \\nbeen designed to provide end-to-end information on the movement of fertilisers \\nand subsidies, from the manufacturer to the retail level. This will be rolled out \\nnation-wide during 2012. Direct transfer of subsidy to the retailer, and eventually \\nto the farmer will be implemented in subsequent phases. This step will benefit \\n12 crore farmer families, while reducing expenditure on subsidies by curtailing \\nmisuse of fertilisers. \\n24. All the three public sector Oil Marketing Companies have launched LPG \\ntransparency portals to improve customer service and reduce leakage. A pilot \\nproject for selling LPG at market price and reimbursement of subsidy directly \\ninto the beneficiary’s bank account is being conducted in Mysore. A similar pilot \\nproject on direct transfer of subsidy for kerosene into the bank accounts of \\nbeneficiaries has been initiated in Alwar district of Rajasthan. The Aadhaar \\nplatform has also been successfully used to validate PDS ration cards in \\nJharkhand. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n6 \\n\\n25. These pilot projects show that substantial economies in subsidy outgo \\ncan be achieved by the use of Aadhaar platform. It will be our endeavour to scale \\nup and roll out these Aadhaar enabled payments for various government schemes \\nin at least 50 selected districts within the next six months. \\nTax Reforms \\n\\n26. As Hon’ble Members are aware, the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) Bill was \\nintroduced in Parliament in August 2010. It was our earnest desire to give effect \\nto DTC from April 1, 2012. However, we received the Report of the Parliamentary \\nStanding Committee on March 9, 2012. We will examine the report expeditiously \\nand take steps for the enactment of DTC at the earliest. \\n27. Similarly, the Constitution Amendment Bill, a preparatory step in the \\nimplementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced in Parliament \\nin March 2011 and is before the Parliamentary Standing Committee. As we await \\nrecommendations of the Committee, drafting of model legislation for Centre \\nand State GST in concert with States is under progress. \\n28. The structure of GST Network (GSTN) has been approved by the \\nEmpowered Committee of State Finance Ministers. GSTN will be set up as a \\nNational Information Utility and will become operational by August 2012. The \\nGSTN will implement common PAN-based registration, returns filing and \\npayments processing for all States on a shared platform. The use of PAN as a \\ncommon identifier in both direct and indirect taxes, will enhance transparency \\nand check tax evasion. I solicit the support of all my colleagues cutting across \\nparty lines for an early passage of these landmark legislations. \\nDisinvestment Policy \\n\\n29. The Government has further evolved its approach to divestment of Central \\nPublic Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The CPSEs are being given a level playing \\nfield vis-a-vis the private sector with regard to practices like buy-backs and listing \\nat stock exchange. The treasury management options for CPSEs have also been \\nenhanced. This will help improve the returns on public assets, support transparent \\nenvironment for the divestment process, besides unlocking the value and resources \\nfor all stakeholders. \\n30. In 2011-12, as against a target of ` 40,000 crore, the Government will \\nraise about ` 14,000 crore from disinvestment. For 2012-13, I propose to raise \\n` 30,000 crore through disinvestment. Let me reiterate here that while we are \\ncommitted to enhancing people’s ownership of CPSEs, at least 51 per cent \\nownership and management control will remain with the Government. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n7 \\n\\nStrengthening Investment Environment \\n\\n31. The domestic investment environment has suffered on multiple counts \\nin the past year. It is time to fast track policy decisions and ensure on-time \\nimplementation of major projects. \\nForeign Direct Investment \\n\\n32. Organised retail helps in reducing cost of intermediation due to economies \\nof scale, benefiting both consumers and producers. At present, FDI in single \\nbrand and in cash and carry wholesale trade is permitted to the extent of 100 per \\ncent. The decision in respect of allowing FDI in multi-brand retail trade up to 51 \\nper cent, subject to compliance with specified conditions, has been held in \\nabeyance. Efforts are on to arrive at a broad based consensus in consultation \\nwith the State Governments. \\nAdvance Pricing Agreement \\n\\n33. In a globalised economy with expanding cross-border production chains \\nand growing trade within entities of the same group, Advance Pricing Agreement \\n(APA) can significantly bring down tax litigation and provide tax certainty to \\nforeign investors. Though, the provision for APA has been included in the DTC \\nBill, 2010, I propose to bring forward its implementation by introducing it in the \\nFinance Bill, 2012. \\nFinancial Sector \\n\\n34. Reforms in the financial sector have been pursued with the objective of \\nmore efficient market intermediation between savers and investors. \\n35. To encourage flow of savings in financial instruments and improve the \\ndepth of domestic capital market, it is proposed to introduce a new scheme called \\nRajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme. The scheme would allow for income tax \\ndeduction of 50 per cent to new retail investors, who invest up to ` 50,000 directly \\nin equities and whose annual income is below ` 10 lakh. The scheme will have \\na lock-in period of 3 years. The details will be announced in due course. \\nCapital Markets \\n\\n36. During the year 2011-12, we took a series of steps to deepen the capital \\nmarket and encourage investment in infrastructure sector. These steps included \\nraising of FII investment limit in long-term infrastructure bonds, corporate bonds \\nand government securities. The limit on External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) \\nwas also raised and qualified foreign investors were allowed to invest in specified \\nIndian mutual funds and directly in equities. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n8 \\n\\n37. I now propose to take the next steps in deepening the reforms in Capital \\nmarket by: \\n• Allowing Qualified Foreign Investors (QFIs) to access Indian \\nCorporate Bond market; \\n• Simplifying the process of issuing Initial Public Offers (IPOs), \\nlowering their costs and helping companies reach more retail \\ninvestors in small towns. To achieve this, in addition to the existing \\nIPO process, I propose to make it mandatory for companies to issue \\nIPOs of ` 10 crore and above in electronic form through nationwide \\nbroker network of stock exchanges; \\n• Providing opportunities for wider shareholder participation in \\nimportant decisions of the companies through electronic voting \\nfacilities, besides existing process for shareholder voting, which \\nwould be made mandatory initially for top listed companies; \\nand \\n• Permitting two-way fungibility in Indian Depository Receipts \\nsubject to a ceiling with the objective of encouraging greater foreign \\nparticipation in Indian capital market. \\nLegislative Reforms \\n\\n38. We have received the recommendations of the Standing Committee on \\nFinance on “The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, \\n2011”, “The Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2011” and “The Insurance Laws \\n(Amendment) Bill, 2008”. The official amendments to these Bills will be moved \\nin this session of the Parliament. \\n39. To take forward the process of financial sector legislative reforms, the \\nGovernment proposes to move the following Bills in the Budget Session of the \\nParliament: \\n• The Micro Finance Institutions (Development and Regulation) Bill, \\n2012; \\n• The National Housing Bank (Amendment) Bill, 2012; \\n• The Small Industries Development Bank of India (Amendment) \\nBill, 2012; \\n• National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \\n(Amendment) Bill, 2012; \\n• Regional Rural Banks (Amendment) Bill, 2012; \\n• Indian Stamp (Amendment) Bill, 2012; and \\n• Public Debt Management Agency of India Bill, 2012. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n9 \\n\\n40. The Enforcement of Security Interest and Recovery of Debts Laws \\n(Amendment) Bill, 2011 has already been introduced in Parliament. \\nCapitalisation of Banks and Financial Holding Company \\n\\n41. The Government is committed to protect the financial health of Public \\nSector Banks and financial institutions. For the year 2012-13, I propose to provide \\n` 15,888 crore for capitalisation of Public Sector Banks, Regional Rural Banks \\nand other financial institutions including NABARD. The Government is also \\nexamining the possibility of creating a financial holding company which will \\nraise resources to meet the capital requirements of Public Sector Banks. \\n42. To bring banking payment structure at par with global standards, a \\ncomprehensive action plan has been prepared for implementation in 2012-13. A \\ncentral Know Your Customer (KYC) depository will be developed in 2012-13 to \\navoid multiplicity of registration and data upkeep. \\nPriority Sector Lending \\n\\n43. A committee set up by RBI to re-examine the existing classification and \\nsuggest revised guidelines on priority sector lending has submitted its report. \\nAfter stakeholder consultation, revised guidelines will be issued. \\nFinancial Inclusion \\n\\n44. In 2010-11, “Swabhimaan” campaign was launched to extend banking \\nfacilities through Business Correspondents to habitations having population in \\nexcess of 2000. I am happy to announce that out of 73,000 identified habitations \\nthat were to be covered by March, 2012, about 70,000 habitations have been \\nprovided with banking facilities. With this, over 2.55 crore beneficiary accounts \\nwould have been operationalised. The remaining habitations are likely to be covered \\nby March 31, 2012. As a next step, Ultra Small Branches are being set up at these \\nhabitations, where the Business Correspondents would deal with cash transactions. \\n45. In 2012-13, I propose to extend the “Swabhimaan” campaign to habitations \\nwith population of more than 1000 in North Eastern and hilly States and to other \\nhabitations which have crossed population of 2,000 as per Census 2011. \\nRegional Rural Banks \\n\\n46. Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) have played a crucial role in meeting the \\ncredit needs of rural areas. I am happy to inform that of the 82 RRBs in India, 81 \\nhave successfully migrated to Core Banking Solutions (CBS) and have also joined \\nthe National Electronic Fund Transfer system. \\n47. The Government had initiated the process of capitalisation of 40 \\nfinancially weak RRBs, which has been completed in respect of 12 RRBs by the \\nend of February, 2012. I propose to extend the scheme of capitalisation of weak \\nRRBs by another 2 years to enable all the States to contribute their share. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n10 \\n\\nIII. Infrastructure and Industrial Development \\nLet me now turn to infrastructure and industrial development. \\n\\n48. Lack of adequate infrastructure is a major constraint on our growth. The \\nstrategy we have followed so far is to increase investment in infrastructure through \\na combination of public investment and public private partnerships (PPP). During \\nthe Twelfth Plan period, infrastructure investment will go up to ` 50 lakh crore. \\nAbout half of this is expected to come from private sector. \\n49. Viability Gap Funding (VGF) under the Scheme for Support to PPP in \\ninfrastructure is an important instrument in attracting private investment into \\nthe sector. This year it has been decided to make irrigation (including dams, \\nchannels and embankments), terminal markets, common infrastructure in \\nagriculture markets, soil testing laboratories and capital investment in fertiliser \\nsector eligible for VGF under this scheme. Oil and Gas/LNG storage facilities \\nand oil and gas pipelines, fixed network for telecommunication and \\ntelecommunication towers will also be made eligible sectors for VGF. \\n50. The Government has approved guidelines for establishing joint venture \\ncompanies by defence Public Sector Undertakings in PPP mode. This will serve \\nthe dual purpose of achieving substantive self-reliance in the defence sector and \\nproduction of state-of-the-art defence goods. \\n51. I had announced the setting up of Infrastructure Debt Funds to tap the \\noverseas markets for long tenor pension and insurance funds. I am happy to \\ninform the House that the first Infrastructure Debt Fund with an initial size of \\n`8000 crore, has been launched earlier this month. \\n52. For the year 2011-12, tax-free bonds for ` 30,000 crore were announced \\nfor financing infrastructure projects. I propose to double it to raise `60,000 crore \\nin 2012-13. This includes `10,000 crore for NHAI, `10,000 crore for IRFC, \\n`10,000 crore for IIFCL, `5,000 crore for HUDCO, `5,000 crore for National \\nHousing Bank, `5,000 crore for SIDBI, `5,000 crore for ports and `10,000 crore \\nfor power sector. \\n53. A harmonised master list of infrastructure sector has been approved by \\nthe Government. This will help in removing ambiguity in the policy and regulatory \\ndomain and encourage investment in the infrastructure sector. \\n54. To ease access of credit to infrastructure projects, India Infrastructure \\nFinance Company Limited (IIFCL) has put in place a structure for credit \\nenhancement and take-out finance. A consortium for direct lending and grant of \\nin-principle approval to developers before the submission of bids for PPP projects \\nhas also been created. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n11 \\n\\nNational Manufacturing Policy \\n\\n55. The Government has announced a National Manufacturing Policy on \\nOctober 25, 2011 with the objective of raising, within a decade, the share of \\nmanufacturing in GDP to 25 per cent and creation of 10 crore jobs. The Policy \\nencourages the setting-up of National Investment and Manufacturing Zones \\n(NIMZs) across the country. \\n56. I will now address some issues that have impacted infrastructure and \\nindustrial activity in the past months. \\nPower and Coal \\n\\n57. In power generation, fuel supply constraints are affecting production \\nprospects. To address this concern, Coal India Limited (CIL) has been advised \\nto sign fuel supply agreements, with power plants that have entered into longterm \\nPower Purchase Agreements with DISCOMs and would get commissioned \\non or before March 31, 2015. An inter-ministerial group is being constituted to \\nundertake periodic review of the allocated coal mines and make recommendations \\non de-allocations, if so required. \\n58. I propose to allow External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) to part finance \\nRupee debt of existing power projects. \\nTransport: Roads and Civil Aviation \\n\\n59. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is set to achieve its \\ntarget of awarding projects covering a length of 7,300 km under NHDP during \\n2011-12. This would be 44 per cent higher than the best ever length of 5,082 km \\nawarded in 2010-11. Of the 44 projects awarded during 2011-12, 24 projects \\nhave fetched a premium. I propose to set a target of covering a length of 8,800 \\nkms under NHDP next year. The allocation of the Ministry has been enhanced \\nby 14 per cent to ` 25,360 crore in 2012-13. \\n60. To encourage public private partnerships in road construction projects, I \\npropose to allow ECB for capital expenditure on the maintenance and operations \\nof toll systems for roads and highways so long as they are a part of the original \\nproject. \\n61. The airline industry is facing financial crisis. The high operating cost of \\nthe sector is largely attributable to the cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF). To \\nreduce the cost of ATF, Government has permitted direct import of ATF by Indian \\nCarriers, as actual users. \\n62. To address the immediate financing concerns of the Civil Aviation sector, \\nI propose to permit ECB for working capital requirements of the airline industry \\nfor a period of one year, subject to a total ceiling of US Dollar 1 billion. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n12 \\n\\n63. A proposal to allow foreign airlines to participate up to 49 per cent in the \\nequity of an air transport undertaking engaged in operation of scheduled and \\nnon-scheduled air transport services is under active consideration of the \\nGovernment. \\nDelhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor \\n\\n64. The Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) is being developed on \\neither side along the alignment of the Western Dedicated Rail Freight Corridor. \\nThe project has made significant progress. In September 2011, Central assistance \\nof `18,500 crore spread over a period of 5 years has been approved. The Japanese \\nPrime Minister has announced US$ 4.5 billion as Japanese participation in DMIC \\nproject. \\nHousing sector \\n\\n65. In view of the shortage of housing for low income groups in major cities \\nand towns, I propose to: \\n• Allow ECB for low cost affordable housing projects; \\n• Set up Credit Guarantee Trust Fund to ensure better flow of \\ninstitutional credit for housing loans; \\n• Enhance provisions under Rural Housing Fund from ` 3000 crore \\nto ` 4000 crore; \\n• Extend the scheme of interest subvention of 1 per cent on housing \\nloan up to `15 lakh where the cost of the house does not exceed \\n`25 lakh for another year; and \\n• Enhance the limit of indirect finance under priority sector from \\n` 5 lakh to ` 10 lakh. \\nFertilisers \\n\\n66. To reduce India’s import dependence in urea, Government has taken steps \\nto finalise pricing and investment policies for urea. It is expected that with the \\nimplementation of the investment policy, country will become self sufficient in \\nmanufacturing urea in the next five years. In case of the potassic-phosphatic \\n(P&K) fertiliser, use of single super phosphate (SSP) will be encouraged through \\ngreater extension work. This fertiliser is manufactured entirely in the domestic \\nsector. Enhanced production would bring down our dependence on imports in \\nthe P&K sector. \\nTextiles \\n\\n67. The Government has recently announced a financial package of ` 3,884 \\ncrore for waiver of loans of handloom weavers and their cooperative societies. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n13 \\n\\n68. In addition to 4 mega handloom clusters already operationalised, I am \\nnow happy to announce two more mega clusters, one to cover Prakasam and \\nGuntur districts in Andhra Pradesh and the other for Godda and neighbouring \\ndistricts in Jharkhand. I also propose to provide assistance in setting up of \\ndormitories for women workers in the 5 mega clusters relating to handloom, \\npower loom and leather sectors. \\n69. The Ministry of Textiles runs Weavers’ Service Centres in different \\nparts of the country for providing technical support to poor handloom weavers. \\nI propose to set up three such Centres, one each in Mizoram, Nagaland and \\nJharkhand. I am also happy to announce ` 500 crore pilot scheme in the \\nTwelfth Plan for promotion and application of Geo-textiles in the North East \\nRegion. \\n70. To address the need of the local artisans and weavers, I propose to set up \\na powerloom mega cluster in Ichalkaranji in Maharashtra with a Budget allocation \\nof ` 70 crore. \\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises \\n\\n71. In order to enhance availability of equity to MSME sector, I propose to \\nset up a ` 5,000 crore India Opportunities Venture Fund with SIDBI. \\n72. The Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the building blocks of \\nour economy. They rely primarily on loans from banks and informal sources to \\nraise capital. To enable these enterprises greater access to finance, two SME \\nexchanges have been launched in Mumbai recently. \\nPublic Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises \\n\\n73. With the objective of promoting market access of Micro and Small \\nEnterprises, Government has approved a policy which requires Ministries and \\nCPSEs to make a minimum of 20 per cent of their annual purchases from MSEs. \\nOf this, 4 per cent will be earmarked for procurement from MSEs owned by SC/ \\nST entrepreneurs. \\nIV. Agriculture \\nI now take up agriculture. \\n\\n74. Agriculture will continue to be a priority for the Government. The total \\nplan outlay for the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation is being increased \\nby 18 per cent from ` 17,123 crore in 2011-12 to ` 20,208 crore in 2012-13. \\n75. The outlay for Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) is being increased \\nfrom `7,860 crore in 2011-12 to ` 9,217 crore in 2012-13. I am happy to inform \\nthe House that the initiative of Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India \\n(BGREI) has resulted in a significant increase in production and productivity of \\npaddy. States in eastern India have reported additional paddy production of seven \\nmillion tonnes in Kharif 2011. I propose to increase the allocation for this scheme \\nfrom `400 crore in 2011-12 to `1000 crore in 2012-13. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n14 \\n\\n76. This year, under RKVY, I also propose to allocate `300 crore to Vidarbha \\nIntensified Irrigation Development Programme. This Scheme seeks to bring in \\nmore farming areas under protective irrigation. \\n77. The Government intends to merge the remaining activities into a set of \\nmissions to address the needs of agricultural development in the Twelfth Five \\nYear Plan. These Missions are: \\n(i) National Food Security Mission which aims to bridge the yield \\ngap in respect of paddy, wheat, pulses, millet and fodder. The \\nongoing Integrated Development of Pulses Villages, Promotion of \\nNutri-cereals and Accelerated Fodder Development Programme \\nwould now become a part of this Mission; \\n(ii) National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture including Micro \\nIrrigation is being taken up as a part of the National Action Plan \\non Climate Change. The Rainfed Area Development Programme \\nwill be merged with this; \\n(iii) National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm aims to increase \\nproduction and productivity of oil seeds and oil palm; \\n(iv) National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology \\nfocuses on adoption of appropriate technologies by farmers for \\nimproving productivity and efficiency in farm operations; and \\n(v) National Horticulture Mission aims at horticulture diversification. \\nThis will also include the initiative on saffron. \\nNational Mission for Protein Supplement \\n\\n78. Mission for Protein Supplement is being strengthened. To improve \\nproductivity in the dairy sector, a `2,242 crore project is being launched with \\nWorld Bank assistance. To broaden the scope of production of fish to coastal \\naquaculture, apart from fresh water aquaculture, the outlay in 2012-13 is being \\nstepped up to `500 crore. Suitable allocations are also being made for poultry, \\npiggery and goat rearing. \\nAgriculture Credit \\n\\n79. Farmers need timely access to affordable credit. I propose to raise the \\ntarget for agricultural credit in 2012-13 to `5,75,000 crore. This represents an \\nincrease of ` 1,00,000 crore over the target for the current year. \\n80. The interest subvention scheme for providing short term crop loans to \\nfarmers at 7 per cent interest per annum will be continued in 2012-13. An \\nadditional subvention of 3 per cent will be available to prompt paying farmers. \\nIn addition, the same interest subvention on post harvest loans up to six months \\nagainst negotiable warehouse receipt will also be available. This will encourage \\nthe farmers to keep their produce in warehouses. \\n81. A Short term RRB Credit Refinance Fund is being set-up to enhance the \\ncapacity of Regional Rural Banks to disburse short term crop loans to the small \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n15 \\n\\nand marginal farmers. I propose to allocate ` 10,000 crore to NABARD for \\nrefinancing the RRBs through this fund. \\n\\n82. Kisan Credit Card (KCC) is an effective instrument for making \\nagricultural credit available to the farmers. KCC scheme will be modified to \\nmake KCC a smart card which could be used at ATMs. \\nAgricultural Research \\n\\n83. Food security and agricultural development in the coming decades would \\ndepend upon scientific and technological breakthroughs in raising productivity. \\nWe have to develop plant and seed varieties that yield more and can resist climate \\nchange. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 200 crore for incentivising research \\nwith rewards, both for institutions and the research team responsible for such \\nscientific breakthroughs. \\nIrrigation \\n\\n84. Unless we recognise water as a resource, the day is not far when water \\nstress will start threatening our agricultural production. Focus on micro irrigation \\nschemes to dovetail these with water harvesting schemes is necessary. To maximise \\nthe flow of benefits from investments in irrigation projects, structural changes in \\nAccelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) are being made. The allocation \\nfor AIBP in 2012-13 is being stepped up by 13 per cent to `14,242 crore. \\n85. To mobilise large resources to fund irrigation projects, a Government \\nowned Irrigation and Water Resource Finance Company is being operationalised. \\nThe Company would start its operations in 2012-13 by focusing on financing \\nsub-sectors like micro-irrigation, contract farming, waste water management and \\nsanitation. \\n86. A flood management project for Kandi sub-division of Murshidabad \\nDistrict has been approved by the Ganga Flood Control Commission at a cost \\nof ` 439 crore, to be taken up for funding under the Flood Management \\nProgramme. \\nNational Mission on Food Processing \\n\\n87. The food processing sector has been growing at an average rate of over 8 \\nper cent over the past 5 years. In order to have a better outreach and to provide \\nmore flexibility to suit local needs, it has been decided that a new centrally \\nsponsored scheme titled “National Mission on Food Processing” would be started, \\nin cooperation with the State Governments in 2012-13. \\n88. The Government has taken steps to create additional foodgrain storage \\ncapacity in the country. Creation of 2 million tonnes of storage capacity in the \\nform of modern silos has already been approved. Nearly 15 million tonnes capacity \\nis being created under the Private Entrepreneur’s Guarantee Scheme, of which 3 \\nmillion tonnes of storage capacity will be added by the end of 2011-12 and 5 \\nmillion would be added next year. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n16 \\n\\nV. Inclusion \\nLet me now take up proposals for inclusive development. \\n\\nScheduled Castes and Tribal Sub Plans \\n\\n89. From the year 2011-12, allocations are being made for Scheduled Castes \\nSub Plan (SCSP) and Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) under separate minor heads as part of \\nthe Plan allocations. In 2012-13, the allocation for SCSP is `37,113 crore which \\nrepresents an increase of 18 per cent over 2011-12. The allocation for TSP in \\n2012-13 is `21,710 crore representing an increase of 17.6 per cent over 2011-12. \\nFood Security \\n\\n90. Our Government has taken definite steps to create food security at the \\nhousehold level by making food a legal entitlement for all targeted people, \\nespecially for the poor and vulnerable segments of our population. The National \\nFood Security Bill, 2011 is before the Parliamentary Standing Committee. \\n91. To ensure that the objectives of the National Food Security Bill are \\neffectively realised, a Public Distribution System Network is being created using \\nthe Aadhaar platform. A National Information Utility for the computerisation of \\nPDS is being created. It will become operational by December 2012. \\nMulti-sectoral Nutrition Augmentation Programme \\n\\n92. Following the decision taken in the Prime Minister’s National Council \\non India’s Nutritional Challenges, a multi-sectoral programme to address maternal \\nand child malnutrition in selected 200 high burden districts is being rolled out \\nduring 2012-13. It will harness synergies across nutrition, sanitation, drinking \\nwater, primary health care, women education, food security and consumer \\nprotection schemes. \\n93. In this context, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme \\nis being strengthened and re-structured. For 2012-13, an allocation of `15,850 \\ncrore has been made as against `10,000 crore in 2011-12. This amounts to an \\nincrease of over 58 per cent. \\n94. National Programme of Mid Day Meals in Schools has enhanced \\nenrolment, retention, attendance, and also helped in improving nutrition levels \\namong children. In 2012-13, I propose to allocate `11,937 crore for this scheme \\nas against `10,380 crore in 2011-12. \\n95. Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls, SABLA, \\nhas been introduced last year with a view to address the nutritional needs and \\nother educational and skill development initiatives for self development of \\nadolescent girls in the age group of 11 to 18 years. For 2012-13, an allocation of \\n`750 crore has been proposed for the scheme. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n17 \\n\\nRural Development and Panchayati Raj \\n\\n96. Along with water quality, poor sanitation is one of the factors contributing \\nto malnourishment. Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that I propose to \\nincrease the budgetary allocation for rural drinking water and sanitation from \\n`11,000 crore in 2011-12 to `14,000 crore in 2012-13. This is an increase of \\nover 27 per cent. \\n97. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has been a successful \\nprogramme. In 2012-13, I propose to raise the allocation by 20 per cent to this \\nscheme by providing `24,000 crore. It will accelerate connectivity in the States. \\n98. A major initiative has been proposed to strengthen Panchayats across the \\ncountry through the Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA). \\nThis programme will expand on the existing schemes for Panchayat capacity \\nbuilding. \\n99. In my Budget Speech last year, I had referred to our focus on the \\ndevelopment of backward regions. We have decided to carry the Backward \\nRegions Grant Fund scheme into the Twelfth Plan with an enhanced allocation \\nof `12,040 crore in 2012-13, an increase of about 22 per cent over BE of \\n2011-12. This includes the State component which covers projects in backward \\nareas in Bihar, West Bengal and the Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region of \\nOdisha, development projects for drought mitigation in the Bundelkhand region \\nand projects under the Integrated Action Plan to accelerate the pace of \\ndevelopment in selected tribal and backward districts. \\nRural Infrastructure Development Fund \\n\\n100. This year, I propose to enhance the allocation under Rural Infrastructure \\nDevelopment Fund (RIDF) to ` 20,000 crore. Further in view of the warehousing \\nshortage in the country, I propose to earmark an amount of ` 5,000 crore from \\nthe above allocation exclusively for creating warehousing facilities under RIDF. \\nEducation \\n\\n101. The Right to Education (RTE) Act is being implemented with effect from \\nApril 1, 2010 through the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). For 2012-13, I have \\nprovided `25,555 crore for RTE-SSA. This is an increase of 21.7 per cent over \\n2011-12. \\n102. In the Twelfth Plan, 6,000 schools have been proposed to be set up at \\nblock level as model schools to benchmark excellence. Of these, 2500 will be \\nset up under Public Private Partnership. \\n103. The Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) was launched in \\nMarch, 2009 to enhance access to quality secondary education. In 2012-13, \\nI have allocated `3,124 crore for RMSA which is nearly 29 per cent higher than \\nthe allocation in 2011-12. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n18 \\n\\n104. A scheme for education loans is being implemented by banks. To ensure \\nbetter flow of credit to deserving students, I propose to set up a Credit Guarantee \\nFund for this purpose. \\nHealth \\n\\n105. They say persistence pays. I am happy to inform Hon’ble Members that \\nno new case of polio was reported in the last one year. By modernising existing \\nunits and setting up a new integrated vaccine unit near Chennai, the Government \\nwill achieve vaccine security and keep the pressure on disease eradication and \\nprevention. \\n106. National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) is being implemented through \\n‘Accredited Social Health Activist’- ‘ASHA’. The scope of ASHA’s activities is \\nbeing enlarged to include prevention of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, ensure 100 \\nper cent immunisation and better spacing of children. At the community level, a \\nmore active role is envisaged for ASHA as the convenor of the Village Health \\nand Sanitation Committee, as also to support the initiative on malnutrition. Since \\nASHAs receive activity-wise, performance-based payments, this will also enhance \\ntheir remuneration. I propose to increase the allocation to NRHM from `18,115 \\ncrore in 2011-12 to `20,822 crore in 2012-13. \\n107. National Urban Health Mission is being launched to encompass the \\nprimary healthcare needs of people in the urban areas. The Pradhan Mantri \\nSwasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) aimed at setting up of AIIMS-like \\ninstitutions and upgradation of existing Government medical colleges is being \\nexpanded to cover upgradation of 7 more Government medical colleges. It will \\nenhance the availability of affordable tertiary health care. \\nEmployment and Skill Development \\n\\n108. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme \\n(MGNREGS) has had a positive impact on livelihood security. For the first time, \\nthere is an effective floor wage rate for rural workers. Distress migration has \\ncome down. Community assets have been created. Productivity of barren and \\nfallow lands has gone up. The need for improving quality of assets and bringing \\nabout greater synergy between MG-NREGA and agriculture and allied rural \\nlivelihoods is being addressed. \\n109. The Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) has been restructured \\ninto National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) to provide self-employment \\nopportunities. A sub-component, Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana, under \\nNRLM seeks to provide better targeting of women farmers. For NRLM, I propose \\nto increase the allocation by over 34 per cent from `2,914 crore in 2011-12 to \\n`3,915 crore in 2012-13. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n19 \\n\\n110. In last year’s Budget I had announced creation of a ‘Women’s SHG’s \\nDevelopment Fund’. This has been set up in NABARD. In 2012-13, I propose to \\nprovide ` 200 crore to enlarge the corpus to ` 300 crore. This Fund will also \\nsupport the objectives of Aajeevika i.e. the National Rural Livelihood Mission. \\nIt will empower women SHGs to access bank credit. I propose to provide interest \\nsubvention to Women SHGs to avail loans up to `3 lakh at 7 per cent per annum. \\nWomen SHGs that repay loans in time will get additional 3 per cent subvention, \\nreducing the effective rate to 4 per cent. The initiative, in the first phase, would \\nfocus on selected 600 Blocks of 150 districts, including the Left Wing Extremism \\naffected districts. \\n111. It is proposed to establish a Bharat Livelihoods Foundation of India \\nthrough Aajeevika. The Foundation would support and scale up civil society \\ninitiatives and interventions particularly in the tribal regions covering around \\n170 districts. Private trusts and philanthropic organisations would be encouraged \\nto partner with the autonomous body that will be managed professionally. \\n112. To encourage micro enterprises, a credit linked subsidy programme \\nnamely Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) is being \\nimplemented through KVIC. The allocation for this programme has been \\nincreased by 23 per cent from `1,037 crore in 2011-12 to `1,276 crore in \\n2012-13. \\nSkill Development \\n\\n113. In 2011-12 National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) approved \\n26 new projects, thereby doubling the number of projects sanctioned since 2009 \\nto 52, with a total funding commitment of ` 1,205 crore. At the end of 10 years, \\nthese projects are expected to train 6.2 crore persons and augment vocational \\ntraining capacity by 1.25 crore per year in the private sector. \\n114. The NSDC partners have opened 496 permanent and 2429 mobile centres \\nin 220 districts across 24 states. More than 89,500 persons have been trained \\nand almost 80 per cent employed. Under NSDC, 10 Sector Skill Councils have \\nbeen sanctioned. Of these, 3 Skill Councils for Automobile, Security and Retail \\nsectors have become operational. For 2012-13, I propose to allocate ` 1000 crore \\nto National Skill Development Fund (NSDF). \\n115. In order to improve the flow of institutional credit for skill development, \\nI propose to set up separate Credit Guarantee Fund. This will benefit youth in \\nacquiring market oriented skills. \\n116. A new scheme titled “Himayat” was introduced in Jammu and Kashmir \\nfrom 2011-12. It aims to provide skill training to one lakh youth in the next five \\nyears. The entire cost of this programme is being borne by the Centre. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n20 \\n\\nSocial security and the needs of weaker sections \\n\\n117. I am raising the allocation under the National Social Assistance \\nProgramme (NSAP) by 37 per cent from ` 6,158 crore in 2011-12 to ` 8,447 \\ncrore in 2012-13. Under the ongoing Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension \\nScheme and Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme for BPL \\nbeneficiaries, the monthly pension amount per person is being raised from ` 200 \\nto ` 300. \\n118. On the death of the primary breadwinner of a BPL family, in the age \\ngroup 18 to 64 years, a lumpsum grant of `10,000 is presently provided under \\nthe National Family Benefit scheme. I propose to double this amount to ` 20,000 \\nand expect a matching contribution by the State Governments. \\n119. In order to promote voluntary savings towards pensions, a co-contributory \\nscheme SWAVALAMBAN was started in September, 2010. Over 5 lakh \\nsubscribers have been enrolled by February 2012. In order to enhance access to \\nthis scheme, LIC has been appointed as an Aggregator and all Public Sector \\nBanks have also been appointed as Points of Presence (PoP) and Aggregators. \\nInstitutions that are being given grants \\n\\n120. The driving force of a modern nation is research and the creation of new \\nknowledge. With this in mind I propose to provide: \\n• ` 25 crore to the Institute of Rural Management, Anand; \\n• ` 50 crore to establish a world-class centre for water quality with \\nfocus on arsenic contamination in Kolkata; \\n• ` 100 crore to Kerala Agricultural University; \\n• ` 50 crore for University of Agricultural Sciences Dharwad, \\nKarnataka; \\n• ` 50 crore to Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural \\nUniversity, Hissar; \\n• ` 50 crore to Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology; \\n• ` 100 crore to Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University in \\nHyderabad; \\n• ` 15 crore to National Council for Applied Economic Research; \\n• ` 10 crore to Rajiv Gandhi University, Department of Economics, \\nItanagar; and \\n• ` 10 crore to Siddharth Vihar Trust Gulbarga, to establish a Pali \\nlanguage Research Centre. \\nSecurity \\n\\n121. In the Budget for 2012-13, a provision of ` 1,93,407 crore has been made \\nfor Defence Services which include `79,579 crore for capital expenditure. As \\nalways, this allocation is based on present needs and any further requirement \\nwould be met. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n21 \\n\\n122. Government is making efforts to increase the availability of residential \\nquarters to forces. In 2012-13, it is envisaged to construct nearly 4,000 residential \\nquarters for Central Armed Police Forces for which ` 1,185 crore is proposed to \\nbe allocated. A provision of ` 3,280 crore for 2012-13 has also been made for \\nconstruction of office buildings including land acquisition and barracks to \\naccommodate 27,000 personnel. \\n123. The scheme to create the National Population Register (NPR) is \\nprogressing well. It is likely to be completed within the next two years. The \\nGovernment is also considering a proposal of issuing Resident Identity Cards \\nbearing the Aadhaar numbers to all residents who are of age 18 years and above \\nto help in the e-governance initiatives. \\nVI. Governance \\nI now address some concerns in governance. \\n\\nUID-Aadhaar \\n\\n124. The enrolments into the Aadhaar system have crossed 20 crore and the \\nAadhaar numbers generated upto date have crossed 14 crore. I propose to allocate \\nadequate funds to complete another 40 crore enrolments starting from \\nApril 1, 2012. The Aadhaar platform is now ready to support the payments of \\nMG-NREGA; old age, widow and disability pensions; and scholarships directly \\nto the beneficiary accounts in selected areas. \\nBlack Money \\n\\n125. Last year I had outlined a five pronged strategy to tackle the malaise of \\ngeneration and circulation of black money and its illegitimate transfer outside \\nIndia. Government has taken a number of proactive steps to implement this \\nstrategy. As a result: \\n• 82 Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) and 17 Tax \\nInformation Exchange Agreements (TIEA) have been finalised and \\ninformation regarding bank accounts and assets held by Indians \\nabroad has started flowing in. In some cases prosecution will be \\ninitiated; \\n• Dedicated exchange of information cell for speedy exchange of \\ntax information with treaty countries is fully functional in CBDT; \\n• India became the 33rd signatory of the Multilateral Convention on \\nMutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters; and \\n• Directorate of Income Tax Criminal Investigation has been \\nestablished in CBDT. \\n126. I propose to lay on the table of the House a white paper on Black Money \\nin the current session of Parliament. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n22 \\n\\nPublic Procurement Legislation \\n\\n127. Government is committed to the enactment of a Public Procurement \\nlegislation to enhance confidence in public procurement and to ensure \\ntransparency and efficiency in the process. The Bill in this regard is to be \\nintroduced in the Budget session of the Parliament. \\n128. The following legislative measures for strengthening anti-corruption \\nframework are in various stages of enactment: \\n• Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill, 2011 \\nintroduced in Parliament with a view to bring certain provisions of \\nthe Act in line with global standards; \\n• Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Bill, 2011 is currently being \\nexamined by the Standing Committee on Finance. It would replace \\nthe ‘Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988’; and \\n• National Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Bill, \\n2011 introduced in Parliament with a view to strengthen legal \\nprovisions for implementation of the national policy on Narcotic \\nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances. \\nVII. Budget Estimates 2012-13 \\nI now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2012-13. \\n\\n129. The Gross Tax Receipts are estimated at ` 10,77,612 crore which is an \\nincrease of 15.6 per cent over the Budget Estimates and 19.5 per cent over the \\nRevised Estimates for 2011-12. As a percentage of GDP, gross taxes are estimated \\nat 10.6 per cent in BE 2012-13 as against 10.4 per cent in BE 2011-12. After \\ndevolution to States, the net tax to Centre in 2012-13 is estimated at ` 7,71,071 \\ncrore. The Non Tax Revenue Receipts for 2012-13 are estimated at ` 1,64,614 \\ncrore and Non-debt Capital Receipts at ` 41,650 crore. The temporary arrangement \\nto use disinvestment proceeds for capital expenditure in social sector schemes is \\nbeing extended for one more year to 2012-13. \\n130. The total expenditure for 2012-13 is budgeted at ` 14,90,925 crore. Of \\nthis, the Plan Expenditure for 2012-13 is ` 5,21,025 crore, which is 18 per cent \\nhigher than the Budget Estimates of 2011-12. This is higher than the 15 per cent \\nincrease projected in the Approach to the Twelfth Plan for 2012-13. I am happy \\nto inform the Hon’ble Members that in the Eleventh Plan, we have been able to \\nmeet 99 per cent of the total plan outlay. \\n131. The Non Plan Expenditure for 2012-13 is budgeted at ` 9,69,900 crore \\nwhich is 8.7 per cent higher than the Revised Estimates for 2011-12 and 18.8 \\nper cent higher than the Budget Estimates for 2011-12. This increase is mainly \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n23 \\n\\non account of higher provision for major subsidies. While making adequate \\nprovisions for funding the desirable subsidies, as indicated earlier, I am \\ndetermined to contain the increasing subsidy burden through measures including \\nimproved targeting. \\n\\n132. The Plan and Non Plan resources transferred to States and Union \\nTerritories including direct transfers to State and district level implementing \\nagencies are ` 3,65,216 crore in BE 2012-13. This includes ` 18,655 crore of \\ngrant to local bodies as per the recommendations of Thirteenth Finance \\nCommission. \\n133. The year 2011-12 was one of challenges for fiscal management. Due to \\nthe slower economic growth, direct tax collection fell short by ` 32,000 crore of \\nthe Budget Estimates. At the same time, the Government absorbed duty reduction \\nin petroleum sector with annual revenue loss of ` 49,000 crore. The Government \\nhad to incur higher expenditure on petroleum and fertiliser subsidy to insulate \\nthe people from the rising prices. While the outgo on account of subsidies \\nincreased, I have ensured that the entire amount is given in cash and not as bonds \\nin lieu of subsidies. This is in line with the approach that I outlined in my Budget \\nSpeech for 2010-11. \\n134. The combined effect of lower tax and disinvestment receipts and higher \\nexpenditure, mainly on account of subsidies, has pushed the fiscal deficit to 5.9 \\nper cent of GDP in the Revised Estimates for 2011-12. However, I have made a \\ndetermined attempt to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation in the Budget \\nfor 2012-13 by pegging the fiscal deficit at ` 5,13,590 crore which is 5.1 per cent \\nof GDP. After taking into account other items of financing, the net market \\nborrowings through dated securities to finance this deficit is ` 4.79 lakh crore. \\nWith this, the total Debt stock at the end of 2012-13 would work out at 45.5 per \\ncent of GDP as compared to the Thirteenth Finance Commission target of 50.5 \\nper cent of GDP. The Effective Revenue Deficit in BE 2012-13 works out to \\n` 1,85,752 crore which is 1.8 per cent of GDP. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n24 \\n\\nPart B \\n\\nVIII. Tax Proposals \\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\nI now come to Part B of my proposals. \\n\\n135. The life of a Finance Minister is not easy. Various players, including \\npolicy makers, politicians, agriculturists and business houses, participate in the \\nmaking of the economy. When everything goes well with the economy, we all \\nshare in the joy. However, when things go wrong, it is the Finance Minister who \\nis called upon to administer the medicine. Economic policy, as in medical \\ntreatment, often requires us to do something, which, in the short run, may be \\npainful, but is good for us in the long run. As Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, \\nhad said in Shakespeare’s immortal words, “I must be cruel only to be kind.” \\nWith this reminder, let me now turn to the tax proposals. \\n\\n136. Last year, I had set the compass for movement towards the DTC in Direct \\nTaxes and GST in Indirect Taxes. My tax proposals for fiscal year 2012-13 mark \\nfurther progress in that direction. \\nDirect Taxes \\n\\nI shall now deal with direct taxes. \\n\\n137. Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by enhancing the \\nexemption limit as a move towards DTC rates. Although DTC will not be \\neffective from this year, I propose to introduce the DTC rates for personal income \\ntax. I propose to enhance the exemption limit for the general category of \\nindividual taxpayers from `1,80,000 to `2,00,000. This measure will provide \\ntax relief upto `2,000 to every taxpayer of this category. I also propose to raise \\nthe upper limit of the 20 per cent tax slab from `8 lakh to `10 lakh. The proposed \\npersonal income tax slabs are: \\nIncome upto `2 lakh Nil \\nIncome above `2 lakh and upto `5 lakh 10 per cent \\nIncome above `5 lakh and upto `10 lakh 20 per cent \\nIncome above `10 lakh 30 per cent \\n\\nThese changes will provide substantial relief to taxpayers. \\n\\n138. I propose to allow individual taxpayers, a deduction of upto `10,000 \\nfor interest from savings bank accounts. This would help a large number of \\nsmall taxpayers with salary incomes upto `5 lakh and interest from savings \\nbank accounts up to ` 10,000, as they would not be required to file income tax \\nreturns. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n25 \\n\\n139. Within the existing limit for deduction allowed for health insurance, \\nI propose to allow a deduction of upto `5,000 for preventive health check-up. \\n140. Senior citizens who do not have any income from business are proposed \\nto be exempted from the payment of advance tax. This will reduce their \\ncompliance burden. \\n141. In the case of corporates, I am not proposing any change in the tax rates. \\nHowever, I propose certain measures to allow corporates to access lower cost \\nfunds and to promote higher level of investments in several sectors. \\n142. In order to provide low cost funds to some stressed infrastructure sectors, \\nthe rate of withholding tax on interest payments on external commercial \\nborrowings is proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 5 per cent for three \\nyears. These sectors are: \\n• power; \\n• airlines; \\n• roads and bridges; \\n• ports and shipyards; \\n• affordable housing; \\n• fertilizer; and \\n• dams \\n143. The restriction on Venture Capital Funds to invest only in nine specified \\nsectors is proposed to be removed. It is further proposed to remove the cascading \\neffect of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) in a multi-tier corporate structure. I \\nalso propose to continue to allow repatriation of dividends from foreign \\nsubsidiaries of Indian companies to India at a lower tax rate of 15 per cent as \\nagainst the tax rate of 30 per cent for one more year i.e. upto March 31, 2013. \\n144. Investment linked deduction of capital expenditure incurred in the \\nfollowing businesses is proposed to be provided at the enhanced rate of 150 per \\ncent, as against the current rate of 100 per cent. \\n• Cold chain facility \\n• Warehouses for storage of food grains \\n• Hospitals \\n• Fertilisers \\n• Affordable housing \\n145. The following new sectors are proposed to be added for the purposes of \\ninvestment linked deduction: \\n• bee keeping and production of honey and beeswax \\n• container freight station and inland container depots \\n• warehousing for storage of sugar \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26 \\n\\n146. To promote investment in research and development, it is proposed to \\nextend the weighted deduction of 200 per cent for R&D expenditure in an \\nin-house facility beyond March 31, 2012 for a further period of five years. \\n147. I also propose to provide weighted deduction of 150 per cent on \\nexpenditure incurred for agri-extension services in order to facilitate growth in \\nthe agriculture sector. \\n148. For the power sector, besides access to low cost funds as outlined above, \\nI also propose extension of the sunset date by one year for power sector \\nundertakings so that they can be set up on or before March 31, 2013 for claiming \\n100 per cent deduction of profits for 10 years. Additional depreciation of 20 per \\ncent in the initial year is proposed to be extended to new assets acquired by \\npower generation companies. \\n149. For SMEs, the turnover limit for compulsory tax audit of accounts as \\nwell as for presumptive taxation is proposed to be raised from `60 lakh to \\n` 1 crore. \\n150. In order to augment funds for SMEs, I propose to exempt capital gains \\ntax on sale of a residential property, if the sale consideration is used for \\nsubscription in equity of a manufacturing SME company for purchase of new \\nplant and machinery. \\n151. Considering the shortage of skilled manpower in the manufacturing sector \\nand to generate employment, I propose to provide weighted deduction at the rate \\nof 150 per cent of expenditure incurred on skill development in manufacturing \\nsector in accordance with specified guidelines. \\n152. In order to reduce transaction costs in the capital markets, I propose \\nreduction in Securities Transaction Tax (STT) by 20 per cent (from 0.125 per \\ncent to 0.1 per cent) on cash delivery transactions. \\n153. In order to moderate the outgo on profit linked deductions, I propose to \\nextend the levy of Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) on all persons other than \\ncompanies, claiming profit linked deductions. \\n154. I propose to introduce a General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) in order \\nto counter aggressive tax avoidance schemes, while ensuring that it is used only \\nin appropriate cases, by enabling a review by a GAAR panel. \\n155. I propose a series of measures to deter the generation and use of \\nunaccounted money. To this end, I propose \\n• Introduction of compulsory reporting requirement in case of assets \\nheld abroad. \\n• Allowing for reopening of assessment upto 16 years in relation to \\nassets held abroad. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n27 \\n\\n• Tax collection at source on purchase in cash of bullion or jewellery \\nin excess of ` 2 lakh. \\n• Tax deduction at source on transfer of immovable property (other \\nthan agricultural land) above a specified threshold. \\n• Tax collection at source on trading in coal, lignite and iron ore. \\n• Increasing the onus of proof on closely held companies for funds \\nreceived from shareholders as well as taxing share premium in \\nexcess of fair market value. \\n• Taxation of unexplained money, credits, investments, expenditures \\netc., at the highest rate of 30 per cent irrespective of the slab of \\nincome. \\n156. My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue \\nloss of ` 4500 crore for the year. \\nIndirect Taxes \\n\\n157. I shall now turn to indirect taxes. In a slight departure from the previous \\nyears, I shall begin with Service Tax. \\nService Tax \\n\\n158. At the end of June this year, this tax will attain adulthood by completing \\n18 years. It is therefore time to shift gears and accelerate ahead. However, service \\ntax needs to confront two important challenges to sustain the journey. These are: \\n• The share of services in taxes remains far below its potential. \\nThere is a need to widen the tax base and strengthen its \\nenforcement; \\n• Service Tax law is complex and sometimes avoidably different \\nfrom Central Excise. We need to bring the two as close as possible \\nin the light of our eventual goal of transition to GST. \\nI have attempted to address both these issues this year. \\n\\n159. Last year, I had initiated a public debate on the desirability of moving \\ntowards taxation of services based on a negative list. In the debate that continued \\nfor the better part of the year, we received overwhelming support for this new \\nconcept. It has been perceived both as sound economics and prudent fiscal \\nmanagement. \\n160. Thus, I propose to tax all services except those in the negative list. The \\nlist comprises 17 heads and has been carefully drawn up, keeping in view the \\nfederal nature of our polity, the best international practices and our socio-economic \\nrequirements. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n28 \\n\\n161. The important inclusions in the negative list comprise all services provided \\nby the government or local authorities, except a few specified services where they \\ncompete with private sector. The list also includes pre-school and school education, \\nrecognised education at higher levels and approved vocational education, renting \\nof residential dwellings, entertainment and amusement services and a large part of \\npublic transportation including inland waterways, urban railways and metered cabs. \\n162. Agriculture and animal husbandry enjoy a very important place in our \\nlives. Practically all services required for cultivation, breeding, production, \\nprocessing or marketing up to the stage the produce is sold in the primary markets \\nare covered by the list. \\n163. In addition to the negative list, there is a list of exemptions which include \\nhealth care, services provided by charities, religious persons, sportspersons, \\nperforming artists in folk and classical arts, individual advocates providing \\nservices to non-business entities, independent journalists, and services by way \\nof animal care or car parking. \\n164. To take financial services to the door steps in rural areas, I have also \\nexempted the services of business facilitators and correspondents to banks and \\ninsurance companies. \\n165. Construction services relating to specified infrastructure, canals, irrigation \\nworks, post-harvest infrastructure, residential dwelling, and low-cost mass \\nhousing up to an area of 60 sq. mtr. under the Scheme of Affordable Housing in \\nPartnership are also included in the exemptions. To make the life of those who \\nalready own an apartment a little easier, I propose to raise the exemption for the \\nmonthly charges payable by a member to a housing society from ` 3,000 to \\n`5,000. \\n166. The Year 2012 marks the beginning of the centenary year of Indian cinema. \\nDespite the change in titles from Dada Saheb Phalke’s “Raja Harishchandra” to \\n“Ra. One” in recent times, the industry has played a pivotal role in unifying our \\ncountry in the wake of her considerable diversity. To add to their spirit of \\ncelebration, I propose to exempt the industry from service tax on copyrights \\nrelating to recording of cinematographic films. \\n167. Movement towards the negative list will result in reducing nearly 290 \\ndefinitions and descriptions in the Act to 54, and the exemptions from the existing \\n88 to 10, of course merging some of the existing exemptions into a revised \\nnotification. In terms of number of pages, the law will be shorter by nearly 40 \\nper cent. \\n168. As a measure of harmonisation between Central Excise and Service Tax, \\na number of alignments have been made. These include a common simplified \\nregistration form and a common return for Central Excise and Service Tax, to be \\nnamed EST-1. This common return will comprise only one page, which will be \\na significant reduction from the 15 pages of the two returns at present. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n29 \\n\\n169. Revision Application Authority and Settlement Commission are being \\nintroduced in Service Tax to help resolve disputes with far greater ease. \\n170. Cascading of taxes has been significantly reduced by permitting utilisation \\nof input tax credits in a number of services such as catering, restaurants, hotel \\naccommodation, pandal and shamiana and transport sectors. \\n171. Place of Supply Rules, that will determine the location where a service \\nshall be deemed to be provided, are being placed in public domain for \\nstakeholders’ comments and shall be notified when the negative list is put into \\neffect. These rules will also provide a possible backdrop to initiate an informed \\ndebate to assess all the issues that may arise in the taxation of inter-state services \\nfor the eventual launch of GST. \\n172. I propose to set up a Study Team to examine the possibility of a common \\ntax code for service tax and central excise which could be adopted to harmonise \\nthe two legislations as much as possible at the right time. \\n173. While the problems faced by exporters of goods with respect to taxes on \\ninput services was addressed earlier this year, disbursement of taxes that go into \\nthe export of services has been an irritant for long. I now announce a new scheme \\nthat will simplify refunds without resorting to voluminous documentation or \\nverification. As an added incentive, such refunds will also be admissible for \\ntaxes on taxable services that have been exempted. \\n174. Rules pertaining to the Point of Taxation are also being rationalised, \\nproviding greater clarity and removing the irritants. Cenvat credits in a number \\nof areas are being restored. There are a number of other proposals both for the \\nfacilitation of business and to check malpractices. I do not wish to take the valuable \\ntime of this House for discussing all these proposals. \\n175. You will notice that most of these measures are guided by the need to \\nmove towards a system that is simple, equitable and progressive but are unlikely \\nto make the exchequer richer in any significant way. Looking at our vast \\ncommitments and to maintain a healthy fiscal situation, I propose to raise the \\nservice tax rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, with consequential changes in \\nrates for services that have individual tax rates. \\n176. My proposals from service tax are expected to yield an additional revenue \\nof ` 18,660 crore. Keeping in mind that the share of services in GDP is 59 per \\ncent, you would agree that the proposed increase is not too harsh. \\nI shall now deal with proposals relating to the other indirect taxes. \\n\\n177. In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008-09, the standard rate of \\nexcise duty for non-petroleum goods was reduced from 14 per cent to 8 per cent \\nin a phased manner. This rate was raised from 8 per cent to 10 per cent in Budget \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n30 \\n\\n2010-11. Given the imperative for fiscal correction, I propose to now raise the \\nstandard rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, the merit rate from 5 per cent to 6 \\nper cent, and the lower merit rate from 1 per cent to 2 per cent. However, the \\nlower merit rate for coal, fertilisers, mobile phones and precious metal jewellery \\nis being retained at 1 per cent. \\n\\n178. Large cars currently attract excise duty depending on their engine capacity \\nand length. In keeping with the increase proposed in the standard rate, I propose \\nto enhance the duty from 22 per cent to 24 per cent. In the case of cars that attract \\na mixed rate of duty of 22 per cent + `15000 per vehicle, I propose to increase \\nthe duty and switch over to an ad valorem rate of 27 per cent. \\n179. No change is proposed in the peak rate of customs duty of 10 per cent on \\nnon-agricultural goods. Barring a few individual items, the rates below the peak \\nare also being retained. \\n180. I shall now take up relief proposals for specific sectors – especially those \\nunder stress. These have been formulated to stimulate investment and \\nmanufacturing growth. \\nAgriculture & Related Sectors \\n\\n181. Carrying forward the initiatives taken for agriculture and agro-processing \\nin the previous Budgets, I propose: \\n• to reduce basic customs duty from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent on: \\n. \\nsugarcane planter, root or tuber crop harvesting machine and \\nrotary tiller and weeder; \\n. \\nparts for the manufacture of these; \\n• to reduce basic customs duty from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent on \\nspecified coffee plantation and processing machinery; \\n• to extend project import benefit to green house and protected \\ncultivation for horticulture and floriculture at concessional basic \\ncustoms duty of 5 per cent; \\n• to reduce basic customs duty on some water soluble fertilisers and \\nliquid fertilisers, other than urea, from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent \\nand from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent; \\n• to extend concessional import duty available for installation of \\nMechanised Handling Systems and Pallet Racking Systems in \\nmandis or warehouses for horticultural produce. \\n182. Imports of equipment for initial setting up or substantial expansion of \\nfertiliser projects are being fully exempted from basic customs duty of 5 per cent \\nfor a period of three years up to March 31, 2015. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n31 \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\n183. In the realm of infrastructure my proposals address some weaknesses in \\nthe troika of power, coal and railways. \\n184. Domestic producers of thermal power have been under stress because of \\nhigh prices of coal. I propose to ease the situation by providing full exemption \\nfrom basic customs duty and a concessional CVD of 1 per cent to Steam coal for \\na period of two years till March 31, 2014. Full exemption from basic duty is also \\nbeing provided to the following fuels for power generation: \\n• Natural Gas and Liquified Natural Gas; and \\n• Uranium concentrate, Sintered Uranium Dioxide in natural and \\npellet form. \\nMining \\n\\n185. Better surveying and prospecting for minerals are essential for improving \\nthe productivity and efficiency of our mining sector. I propose to reduce basic \\ncustoms duty on machinery and instruments for surveying and prospecting from \\n10 per cent or 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. In addition, full exemption from basic \\ncustoms duty is being provided to coal mining projects. \\nRailways \\n\\n186. Over the next five years, Indian Railways are undertaking two major \\nprojects for passenger safety and better service delivery. These are - the installation \\nof Train Protection and Warning System and upgradation of track structure for \\nhigh speed trains. I propose to reduce basic customs duty on equipment required \\nfor their implementation from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. \\nRoads \\n\\n187. Full exemption from import duty on specified equipment imported for \\nroad construction by contractors of Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, \\nNHAI and State Governments is being extended to contracts awarded by \\nMetropolitan Development Authorities. \\n188. Tunnel boring machines and parts for their assembly are covered by \\nthis exemption. I propose to allow their import free of duty without end-use \\ncondition. \\nCivil Aviation \\n\\n189. India has potential for establishing itself as a hub for third-party \\nMaintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) of civilian aircraft. To actualize this \\npotential, I propose to fully exempt from basic customs duty parts of aircraft and \\ntesting equipment imported for this purpose. As a measure of support to the \\nairline industry, it is also proposed to fully exempt both new and retreaded aircraft \\ntyres from basic customs duty and excise duty. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n32 \\n\\nManufacturing \\n\\n190. My proposals for the manufacturing sector that needs support at this \\njuncture, seek to provide relief through cost reduction of raw materials, inputs, \\ncomponents and capital goods. \\n191. To encourage enrichment of low-grade iron ore, of which we have huge \\nreserves, I propose to reduce basic customs duty on plant and machinery imported \\nfor setting up or substantial expansion of iron ore pellet plants or iron ore \\nbeneficiation plants from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. My other proposals relating \\nto the steel sector are as under: \\n• to reduce basic customs duty on: \\n. \\ncoating material for manufacture of electrical steel from 7.5 \\nper cent to 5 per cent \\n. \\nnickel ore and concentrate and nickel oxide/ hydroxide from \\n2.5 per cent or 7.5 per cent to Nil \\n• to enhance export duty on chromium ore from `3000 per tonne to \\n30 per cent ad valorem \\n• to enhance basic customs duty on non-alloy, flat-rolled steel from \\n5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. \\n192. Our textile industry, especially the weaving sector, urgently needs to \\nmodernise. I propose to fully exempt automatic shuttle-less looms from basic \\ncustoms duty of 5 per cent. Similarly, full exemption from basic duty is being \\naccorded to automatic silk reeling and processing machinery as well as its parts. \\nIt is also proposed to restrict these exemptions and the existing concessional rate \\nof basic customs duty of 5 per cent only to new textile machinery. Second-hand \\nmachinery would now attract basic duty of 7.5 per cent. Other proposals on \\ntextiles are: \\n• to reduce basic customs duty on wool waste and wool tops from \\n15 per cent to 5 per cent \\n• to reduce basic customs duty on Titanium dioxide from 10 per \\ncent to 7.5 per cent \\n• to extend full exemption from basic customs duty to aramid yarn \\nand fabric used for the manufacture of bullet proof helmets \\n193. Excise duty of 10 per cent is applicable to branded ready-made garments \\nwith abatement of 55 per cent from the Retail Sale Price. Along with increase in \\nduty to 12 per cent, I propose to enhance the abatement to 70 per cent. As a \\nresult, the incidence of duty as a percentage of the Retail Sale Price would come \\ndown from 4.5 per cent to 3.6 per cent. \\n194. Our MSME sector is fertile ground for the production of low-cost medical \\ndevices. In order to provide impetus to this sector, I propose to reduce basic \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33 \\n\\ncustoms duty to 2.5 per cent with concessional CVD of 6 per cent on specified \\nparts, components and raw materials for the manufacture of some disposables \\nand instruments. Full exemption from basic customs duty and CVD is also being \\nextended to specified raw materials for the manufacture of coronary stents and \\nheart valves. These concessions would be subject to actual user condition. \\n\\n195. My other proposals to support the manufacturing sector include: \\n• Full exemption from basic customs duty on \\n. \\nwaste paper, \\n. \\nLCD and LED TV panels, and parts of memory card for \\nmobile phones \\n• Reduction of basic customs duty on specified raw materials for the \\nmanufacture of adult diapers from 10 per cent or 7.5 per cent to 5 \\nper cent with CVD of 6 per cent and nil special CVD. \\n196. My attention has been drawn to the plight of a few sectors that are highly \\nlabour-intensive and produce items of mass consumption. As a measure of \\nsupport, I propose to enhance basic customs duty on bicycles from 10 per cent to \\n30 per cent and on bicycle parts from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. \\n197. Full exemption from excise duty is currently available to hand-made \\nmatches while others attract the standard rate. It is proposed to reduce excise \\nduty on matches manufactured by semi-mechanised units from 10 per cent to 6 \\nper cent. \\nHealth and Nutrition \\n\\n198. It is proposed to extend concessional basic customs duty of 5 per cent \\nwith full exemption from excise duty/CVD to six specified life-saving drugs/ \\nvaccines. These are used for the treatment or prevention of ailments such as \\nHIV-AIDS, renal cancer, etc. \\n199. Protein deficiency among women and children is one of the most common \\nsources of malnutrition in India. I propose to reduce basic customs duty on Soya \\nprotein concentrate and isolated soya protein from 30 per cent or 15 per cent \\nrespectively to 10 per cent. Simultaneously, excise duty on all processed soya \\nfood products is being reduced to the merit rate of 6 per cent. \\n200. Consumption of iodised salt prevents iodine deficiency and related \\ndiseases. I propose to provide a concessional basic customs duty of 2.5 per cent \\nalong with reduced excise duty of 6 per cent on iodine. \\n201. Probiotics are a cost-effective means of combating bacterial infections. \\nIt is proposed to reduce the basic customs duty on this item from 10 per cent to \\n5 per cent. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n34 \\n\\nEnvironment \\n\\n202. In order to fully realise our potential in the realm of solar energy, solar \\nthermal projects need encouragement. I propose to fully exempt plant and \\nequipment etc. for the initial setting up of such projects from special CVD. \\n203. Concessions have already been provided for encouraging the consumption \\nof energy-saving devices. I propose to fully exempt a coating chemical used for \\ncompact fluorescent lamps, from basic customs duty. Excise duty on LED lamps \\nis also being reduced to 6 per cent. \\n204. Specified parts required for the manufacture of hybrid vehicles enjoy \\nfull exemption from basic customs duty and special CVD with concessional \\nexcise duty/ CVD of 6 per cent. This concession is being extended to specified \\nadditional items and lithium ion batteries imported for the manufacture of battery \\npacks for supply to electric or hybrid vehicle manufacturers. \\n205. One of the primary drivers of the current account deficit has been the \\ngrowth of almost 50 per cent in imports of gold and other precious metals in the \\nfirst three quarters of this year. I have been advised to strengthen the steps \\nalready taken to check this trend for better results. I propose to increase basic \\ncustoms duty on standard gold bars; gold coins of purity exceeding 99.5 per cent \\nand platinum from 2 per cent to 4 per cent and on non-standard gold from 5 per \\ncent to 10 per cent. In sync with these, basic duty on gold ore, concentrate and \\ndore bars for refining is being enhanced from 1 per cent to 2 per cent. On the \\nexcise side, duty on refined gold is being increased in the same proportion from \\n1.5 per cent to 3 per cent. \\n206. In order to prevent round-tripping, it is proposed to impose basic customs \\nduty of 2 per cent on cut and polished, coloured gem stones at par with diamonds. \\nAdditional Resource Mobilisation \\n\\n207. I shall now take up my proposals on “demerit” goods. I propose to \\nincrease basic excise duty on cigarettes of more than 65mm length by adding \\nan ad valorem component of 10 per cent to the existing specific rates. The ad \\nvalorem duty would be chargeable on 50 per cent of the Retail Sale Price \\ndeclared on the pack. \\n208. I also propose to carry out a nominal increase in basic excise duty on \\nhand-rolled bidis from `8 to `10 per thousand and on machine-rolled bidis from \\n`19 to `21 per thousand. The existing exemption available to hand-rolled bidis \\nfor clearances up to 20 lakh bidis per annum is being retained. \\n209. Pan masala, gutkha, chewing tobacco, unmanufactured tobacco and zarda \\nscented tobacco in pouches are leviable to excise duty under the compounded \\nlevy scheme. The rates of duty specified per packing machine for these items are \\nbeing stepped up taking into account improvements in the efficiency of machines \\nused by this industry. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n35 \\n\\n210. Crude petroleum oil produced in India attracts a cess of `2,500 per metric \\ntonne under the Oil Industries Development Act. This rate was last revised in \\nBudget 2006-07. As a measure of indexation, I propose to increase the rate of \\ncess to `4,500 per metric tonne. \\n211. Completely Built Units of large cars/ MUVs/ SUVs having engine \\ncapacity above a prescribed threshold and whose value exceeds US dollar 40,000 \\nper vehicle are permitted for import without type approval. Basic customs duty \\non such vehicles is being enhanced from 60 per cent to 75 per cent ad valorem. \\nRationalisation Measures \\n\\n212. Packaged cement, whether manufactured by mini-cement plants or others, \\nattracts differential excise duty depending on the Retail Sale Price per bag. It is \\nproposed to prescribe a unified rate of 12 per cent + `120 PMT for non-mini \\ncement plants and 6 per cent + `120 PMT for mini-cement plants. It is proposed \\nto charge this duty on the Retail Sale Price less abatement of 30 per cent. \\n213. The House would recall that I had re-introduced a levy of excise duty of \\n1 per cent on branded precious metal jewellery in the last Budget. As a measure \\nof rationalisation, I propose to include jewellery, not bearing a brand name, under \\nits ambit. However, to simplify its operation and minimise its impact on small \\nartisans and goldsmiths, I propose: \\n• to charge this duty on tariff value equal to 30 per cent of the \\ntransaction value; \\n• to extend small-scale exemption up to annual turnover not \\nexceeding `1.5 crore for units having a turnover below ` 4 crore in \\nthe previous year; \\n• to compute turnover on the basis of tariff value; and \\n• to place the onus of registration and payment on the person who \\ngets jewellery manufactured on job-work. \\n214. I propose to fully exempt branded silver jewellery from excise duty. \\n215. Building of commercial vehicle bodies is currently exempt from excise \\nduty. In lieu of this duty, a specific rate of `10,000 is being charged on chassis in \\naddition to the applicable ad valorem duty. This duty structure is regressive. It is \\nproposed to convert the specific component of duty to an ad valorem rate of 3 \\nper cent. \\n216. In the last Budget, excise duty exemption on ships and vessels including \\ndredgers was withdrawn. Accordingly, CVD of 5 per cent became leviable on \\ntheir imports. As the intention was not to levy this duty on the import of foreign-\\ngoing vessels, I propose to exempt such vessels from CVD retrospectively. \\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n36 \\n\\nHowever, to ensure that ships, vessels and dredgers manufactured in India do \\nnot face disability vis-à-vis foreign-going ships converting into coastal vessels, \\nnecessary safeguard is being provided. \\n\\nBaggage Allowance \\n\\n217. Baggage allowance for Indians travelling abroad was last revised in 2004. \\nI propose to increase the duty-free allowance for eligible passengers of Indian \\norigin from `25,000 to `35,000 and for children of up to 10 years from `12,000 \\nto `15,000. \\n218. My proposals relating to Customs and Central excise are estimated to \\nresult in a net revenue gain of ` 27,280 crore for a full year. \\n219. My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue \\nloss of `4500 crore for the year. Proposals relating to Indirect Taxes are estimated \\nto result in a net revenue gain of `45,940 crore, leaving a net gain of `41,440 \\ncrore in the Budget. \\n220. For the Indian economy, this was a challenging year. A number of global \\nand domestic factors militated against the growth that had revived in the last two \\nyears. But India has thrived under challenges and India will do so now. In the \\nmiddle of every crisis, there is also an opportunity. It is an opportunity to rethink, \\nre-assess and make way for new ideas and policies. It is in this spirit that \\nI approached the Budget of this year. The aim is to create an enabling atmosphere \\nfor corporates, farmers, entrepreneurs and workers to take initiatives for robust \\ngrowth. The aim is also to ensure that the benefits of growth reach all sections of \\npopulation. India stands on the brink of a major resurgence. Whether or not \\ntoday’s announcements make tomorrow morning’s headlines matters little, as \\nlong as they help in shaping the headlines that describe India a decade from now. \\nMadam Speaker, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House. \\n\\nhttp://indiabudget.nic.in', 'Budget 2013-2014 \\n\\nSpeech of \\n\\nP. Chidambaram \\n\\nMinister of Finance \\n\\nFebruary 28, 2013 \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\nI rise to present the Budget for the year 2013-14. \\n\\n2. I recall my last tenure as Finance Minister and acknowledge with gratitude \\nthe splendid support that I received from all sections of the House as well as the \\npeople of India. Today, more than ever, I seek the same support as we navigate \\nthe Indian economy through a crisis that has enveloped the whole world and \\nspared none. \\n3. I intend to keep my speech simple, straight forward and reasonably short. \\nI. THE ECONOMY AND THE CHALLENGES \\n4. I shall begin by setting the context. Global economic growth slowed \\nfrom 3.9 percent in 2011 to 3.2 percent in 2012. India is part of the global \\neconomy: our exports and imports amount to 43 percent of GDP and two-way \\nexternal sector transactions have risen to 108 percent of GDP. We are not \\nunaffected by what happens in the rest of the world and our economy too has \\nslowed after 2010-11. In the current year, the CSO has estimated growth at 5 \\npercent while the RBI has estimated growth at 5.5 percent. Whatever may be \\nthe final estimate, it will be below India’s potential growth rate of 8 percent. \\nGetting back to that growth rate is the challenge that faces the country. \\n5. Let me say, however, there is no reason for gloom or pessimism. Even \\nnow, of the large countries of the world, only China and Indonesia are growing \\nfaster than India in 2012-13. And in 2013-14, if we grow at the rate projected by \\nmany forecasters, only China will grow faster than India. Between 2004 and \\n2008, and again in 2009-10 and 2010-11, the growth rate was over 8 percent \\nand, in fact, crossed 9 percent in four of those six years. The average for the 11th \\nPlan period, entirely under the UPA Government, was 8 percent, the highest \\never in any Plan period. Achieving high growth, therefore, is not a novelty or \\nbeyond our capacity. We have done it before and we can do it again. \\n\\x0c\\n2 \\n\\n6. I acknowledge that the Indian economy is challenged, but I am absolutely \\nconfident that, with your cooperation, we will get out of the trough and get on to \\nthe high growth path. I shall now outline our plans and priorities. \\n7. Our goal is ‘higher growth leading to inclusive and sustainable \\ndevelopment’. That is the mool mantra. \\n8. Growth is a necessary condition and we must unhesitatingly embrace \\ngrowth as the highest goal. It is growth that will lead to inclusive development, \\nwithout growth there will be neither development nor inclusiveness. However, \\nI may sound a note of caution. Owing to the plurality and diversity of India, and \\ncenturies of neglect, discrimination and deprivation, many sections of the people \\nwill be left behind if we do not pay special attention to them. As Joseph Stiglitz, \\nNobel prize-winning economist, said, “There is a compelling moral case for \\nequity; but it is also necessary if there is to be sustained growth. A country’s \\nmost important resource is its people.” We have examples of States growing at \\na fast rate, but leaving behind women, the scheduled castes, the scheduled tribes, \\nthe minorities, and some backward classes. The UPA does not accept that model. \\nThe UPA Government believes in inclusive development, with emphasis on \\nimproving human development indicators. I hope this Budget will be yet another \\ntestimony to that commitment. \\nFiscal Deficit, Current Account Deficit and Inflation \\n\\n9. The purpose of a Budget – and the job of a Finance Minister – is to create \\nthe economic space and find the resources to achieve the socio economic \\nobjectives. At present, the economic space is constrained because of a high \\nfiscal deficit; reliance on foreign inflows to finance the current account deficit; \\nlower savings and lower investment; a tight monetary policy to contain inflation; \\nand strong external headwinds. During the course of my speech, I shall spell out \\nmeasures that will address each of these issues. \\n10. In September, 2012, Government accepted the main recommendations \\nof the Dr. Vijay Kelkar Committee. A new fiscal consolidation path was \\nannounced. Red lines were drawn for the fiscal deficit at 5.3 percent of GDP \\nthis year and 4.8 percent of GDP in 2013-14. I know there is a lot of scepticism. \\nIn a little while, I shall tell you how we have fared. \\n11. My greater worry is the current account deficit (CAD). The CAD \\ncontinues to be high mainly because of our excessive dependence on oil imports, \\nthe high volume of coal imports, our passion for gold, and the slow down in \\nexports. This year, and perhaps next year too, we have to find over USD 75 \\nbillion to finance the CAD. There are only three ways before us: FDI, FII or \\nExternal Commercial Borrowing (ECB). That is why I have been at pains to \\nstate over and over again that India, at the present juncture, does not have the \\nchoice between welcoming and spurning foreign investment. If I may be frank, \\nforeign investment is an imperative. What we can do is to encourage foreign \\ninvestment that is consistent with our economic objectives. \\n\\x0c\\n3 \\n\\n12. Finally, the development must be sustainable – economically and \\necologically. The development model must have democratic legitimacy and \\napproval. \\n13. Looming large over our efforts to stimulate growth is inflation. Some \\ninflation is imported. Supply demand mismatch, for example in oilseeds and \\npulses, also pushes up inflation. Aggregate demand is another cause of inflation. \\nThe battle against inflation must be fought on all fronts. Our efforts in the past \\nfew months have brought down headline WPI inflation to about 7.0 percent and \\ncore inflation to about 4.2 percent. It is food inflation that is worrying, and we \\nshall take all possible steps to augment the supply side to meet the growing \\ndemand for food items. \\n14. Government expenditure boosts aggregate demand and it has both good \\nand bad consequences. Wisdom lies in finding the correct level of government \\nexpenditure. In the budget for 2012-13, the estimate of Plan Expenditure was \\ntoo ambitious and the estimate of non-Plan Expenditure was too conservative. \\nFaced with a huge fiscal deficit, I had no choice but to rationalise expenditure. \\nWe took a dose of bitter medicine. It seems to be working. We also took some \\npolicy decisions that had been deferred for too long, corrected some prices, and \\nundertook a review of certain tax policies. We have retrieved some economic \\nspace. As I outline our plans and priorities, Hon’ble Members will find that I \\nhave used that economic space to advantage – and to advance the UPA \\nGovernment’s socio-economic objectives. \\nII. THE PLAN AND BUDGETARY ALLOCATIONS \\n15. The 12th Five Year Plan began in 2012-13. Anticipating a global and \\ndomestic recovery, total expenditure had been fixed at `14,90,925 crore. Due to \\nthe slowdown and the austerity measures, the revised estimate is `14,30,825 \\ncrore or 96 percent of the budget estimate. The economic space that we have \\ngained has given me the confidence to be more ambitious in 2013-14. I have \\nbeen able to set the BE of total expenditure at `16,65,297 crore and of plan \\nexpenditure at `5,55,322 crore. Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that \\nplan expenditure in 2013-14 will be 29.4 percent more than the revised estimate \\nof the current year. All flagship programmes have been fully and adequately \\nfunded. I dare say I have provided sufficient funds to each Ministry or Department \\nconsistent with their capacity to spend the funds. Now, it is over to the Ministries \\nand Departments to deliver the outcomes through good governance, prudent \\ncash management, close monitoring and timely implementation. \\n16. Madam Speaker, on the one side is economic policy. On the other side is \\neconomic welfare. We are a developing country. The link between policy and \\nwelfare can be expressed in a few words: opportunities, education, skills, jobs \\nand incomes. Every mother understands this. Every young man and woman \\nunderstands this. My budget for 2013-14 has before it one overarching goal: to \\ncreate opportunities for our youth to acquire education and skills that will get \\n\\x0c\\n4 \\n\\nthem decent jobs or self-employment that will bring them adequate incomes that \\nwill enable them to live with their families in a safe and secure environment. \\n\\nSC, ST, Women and Children \\n\\n17. Let me assure Hon’ble Members that their concerns are my concerns \\ntoo. I know their concern for the welfare and progress of the scheduled castes \\nand the scheduled tribes for whom the Budget has sub plans. I also know their \\nconcern that adequate funds must be provided for programmes that benefit \\nwomen, children and the minorities. I have tried to meet these concerns as fully \\nas possible. I propose to allocate `41,561 crore to the scheduled caste sub plan \\nand `24,598 crore to the tribal sub plan. The total represents an increase of 12.5 \\npercent over the BE and 31 percent over the RE of the current year. I reiterate \\nthe rule that the funds allocated to the sub plans cannot be diverted and must be \\nspent for the purposes of the sub plans. \\n18. I have made sufficient allocations to programmes relating to women and \\nchildren. Hon’ble Members will find from the budget documents that the gender \\nbudget has `97,134 crore and the child budget has `77,236 crore in \\n2013-14. \\n19. Women belonging to the most vulnerable groups, including single women \\nand widows, must be able to live with self-esteem and dignity. Young women \\nface gender discrimination everywhere, especially at the work place. Ministry \\nof Women and Child Development has been asked to design schemes that will \\naddress these concerns. I propose to provide an additional sum of `200 crore to \\nthat Ministry to begin work in this regard. \\nMinorities \\n\\n20. I have allocated `3,511 crore to the Ministry of Minority Affairs. This is \\nan increase of 12 percent over the BE and 60 percent over the RE of 2012-13. \\n21. The Maulana Azad Education Foundation is the main vehicle to \\nimplement educational schemes and channelize funds to non-government \\norganisations for the minorities. Its corpus stands at `750 crore. With the objective \\nof raising it to `1,500 crore during the 12th Plan period, I propose to allocate \\n`160 crore to the corpus fund. The Foundation wishes to add medical aid to its \\nobjectives. I have accepted that a beginning can be made by providing medical \\nfacilities such as an infirmary or a resident doctor in the educational institutions \\nrun or funded by the Foundation. I propose to allocate `100 crore to launch this \\ninitiative. \\nDisabled Persons \\n\\n22. Government is committed to provide support to persons with disabilities. \\nI propose to allocate a sum of `110 crore to the Department of Disability Affairs \\nfor the ADIP Scheme in 2013-14, as against the RE of `75 crore in the current \\nyear. \\n\\x0c\\n5 \\n\\nHealth and Education \\n\\n23. Health for all and education for all remain our priorities. \\n24. I propose to allocate `37,330 crore to the Ministry of Health and Family \\nWelfare. Of this, the new National Health Mission that combines the rural mission \\nand the proposed urban mission will get `21,239 crore, an increase of 24.3 percent \\nover the RE. \\n25. I propose to provide `4,727 crore for medical education, training and \\nresearch. \\n26. The National Programme for the Health Care of Elderly is being \\nimplemented in 100 selected districts of 21 States. Eight regional geriatric centres \\nare being funded for the development of dedicated geriatric departments. I \\npropose to provide `150 crore for this programme. \\n27. Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy are being mainstreamed \\nthrough the National Health Mission. I propose to allocate `1,069 crore to the \\nDepartment of AYUSH. \\n28. The six AIIMS-like institutions have admitted their first batch of students \\nin the academic session that commenced in September 2012. The hospitals \\nattached to the colleges will be functional in 2013-14. I propose to provide a \\nsum of `1,650 crore for these institutions. \\n29. Education is the other high priority. I propose to allocate `65,867 crore \\nto the Ministry of Human Resource Development, which is an increase of 17 \\npercent over the RE of the previous year. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and \\nthe Right to Education Act are firmly in place. I propose to provide `27,258 \\ncrore for SSA in 2013-14. \\n30. Investment in the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) cannot \\nbe postponed any longer. Hence, I propose to provide `3,983 crore for RMSA, \\nwhich is an increase of 25.6 percent over the RE of the current year. \\n31. Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that thousands of scholarships \\nwill be given to students belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other \\nBackward Classes and Minorities, and girl children, in 2013-14. I propose to \\nallocate `5,284 crore to the various Ministries for the purpose, as compared \\n`4,575 crore in the RE of the current year. \\n32. The Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDM) will be provided `13,215 crore. \\n33. The reconstruction of the Nalanda University has gathered momentum. \\nThe Government is committed to the creation of Nalanda University as a centre \\nof educational excellence. \\n\\x0c\\n6 \\n\\nICDS \\n\\n34. I commend the ICDS for being able to spend the entire amount of `15,850 \\ncrore provided in 2012-13. In recognition of the needs of children, I propose to \\nallocate `17,700 crore in 2013-14, representing an increase of 11.7 percent. The \\nfocus will continue to be on early childhood care and education. \\n35. Maternal and child malnutrition in a country with abundant foodgrains is \\na shame that we must overcome. A multi-sectoral programme that was announced \\nlast year will be implemented in 100 districts during 2013-14 and it will be \\nscaled up to cover 200 districts the year after. I propose to allocate a sum of \\n`300 crore for the programme in 2013-14. \\nDrinking Water \\n\\n36. Clean drinking water and sanitation have a number of beneficial \\nexternalities. I propose to allocate `15,260 crore to the Ministry of Drinking \\nWater and Sanitation, as against the RE of `13,000 crore in the current year. \\n37. There are still 2,000 arsenic- and 12,000 fluoride-affected rural habitations \\nin the country. I propose to provide `1,400 crore towards setting up water \\npurification plants. \\nRural Development \\n\\n38. The Ministry of Rural Development steers a number of flagship \\nprogrammes. We estimate that they will be able to spend `55,000 crore before \\nthe end of the current year, and I propose to allocate `80,194 crore in 2013-14, \\nmarking an increase of 46 percent. MGNREGS will get `33,000 crore, PMGSY \\nwill get `21,700 crore, and IAY will get `15,184 crore. \\n39. The objectives of PMGSY have been substantially fulfilled in several \\nStates. Naturally, these States wish to do more. Hence, it is proposed to carve \\nout PMGSY-II and allocate a portion of the funds to the new programme that \\nwill benefit States such as Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, \\nPunjab and Rajasthan. Details of PMGSY-II will be announced by the Minister \\nof Rural Development in due course. \\nJNNURM \\n\\n40. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) is \\nbeing continued in the 12th Plan. The 14,000 buses sanctioned during 2009 to \\n2012 have made a big contribution to urban transport. I propose to provide \\n`14,873 crore for JNNURM, as against the RE of `7,383 crore in the current \\nyear. Out of this, a significant portion will be used to support the purchase of \\nupto 10,000 buses, especially by the hill States. \\n\\x0c\\n7 \\n\\nIII. AGRICULTURE \\n41. Thanks to our hard working farmers, agriculture continues to perform \\nvery well. The average annual growth rate of agriculture and allied sector during \\nthe 11th Plan was 3.6 percent as against 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, \\nin the 9th and 10th Plans. In 2012-13, total foodgrain production will be over 250 \\nmillion tonnes. Minimum support price of every agricultural produce under the \\nprocurement programme has been increased significantly under the UPA \\nGovernment. Farmers have responded to the price signals and produced more. \\nAgricultural exports from April to December, 2012 have crossed `138,403 crore. \\n42. I propose to allocate `27,049 crore to the Ministry of Agriculture, an \\nincrease of 22 percent over the RE of the current year. Of this, agricultural \\nresearch will be provided `3,415 crore. \\nAgricultural Credit \\n\\n43. Agricultural credit is the driver of agricultural production. We will exceed \\nthe target of `575,000 crore fixed for 2012-13. For 2013-14, I propose to increase \\nthe target to `700,000 crore. \\n44. The interest subvention scheme for short-term crop loans will be continued \\nand a farmer who repays the loan on time will be able to get credit at 4 percent \\nper annum. So far, the scheme has been applied to loans extended by public \\nsector banks, RRBs and cooperative banks. I propose to extend the scheme to \\ncrop loans borrowed from private sector scheduled commercial banks in respect \\nof loans given within the service area of the branch concerned. \\nGreen Revolution \\n\\n45. Bringing the green revolution to eastern India has been a remarkable \\nsuccess. Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal have increased their \\ncontribution to rice production. I propose to continue to support the eastern \\nIndian States with an allocation of `1000 crore in 2013-14. \\n46. The original Green Revolution States face the problem of stagnating yields \\nand over-exploitation of water resources. The answer lies in crop diversification. \\nI propose to allocate `500 crore to start a programme of crop diversification that \\nwould promote technological innovation and encourage farmers to choose crop \\nalternatives. \\n47. The Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana is intended to mobilise higher \\ninvestment in agriculture and the National Food Security Mission is intended to \\nbridge yield gaps. I propose to provide `9,954 crore and `2,250 crore, respectively, \\nfor these two programmes. \\n48. Small and marginal farmers are vulnerable everywhere, and especially \\nso in drought prone and ecologically-stressed regions. Watershed management \\n\\x0c\\n8 \\n\\nis crucial to improve productivity of land and water use. I propose to increase \\nthe allocation for the integrated watershed programme from `3,050 crore in \\n2012-13 (BE) to `5,387 crore. \\n\\n49. Eminent agricultural scientists have suggested that we start a pilot \\nprogramme on Nutri-Farms for introducing new crop varieties that are rich in \\nmicro-nutrients such as iron-rich bajra, protein-rich maize and zinc-rich wheat. \\nI propose to provide a sum of upto `200 crore to start the pilots. Ministry of \\nAgriculture will formulate a scheme and I hope that agri businesses and farmers \\nwill come together to start a sufficient number of pilots in the districts most \\naffected by malnutrition. \\n50. The National Institute of Biotic Stress Management for addressing plant \\nprotection issues will be established at Raipur, Chhattisgarh. The Indian Institute \\nof Agricultural Bio-technology will be established at Ranchi, Jharkhand and will \\nserve as a centre of excellence in agricultural bio-technology. \\n51. A pilot scheme to replant and rejuvenate coconut gardens that was \\nimplemented in some districts of Kerala and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands \\nwill be extended to the entire State of Kerala, and I propose to provide an \\nadditional sum of `75 crore in 2013-14. \\nFarmer Producer Organizations \\n\\n52. Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO), including Farmer Producer \\nCompanies (FPC), have emerged as aggregators of farm produce and link farmers \\ndirectly to markets. To signal our support to them, I intend to provide matching \\nequity grants to registered FPOs upto a maximum of `10 lakh per FPO to enable \\nthem to leverage working capital from financial institutions. I propose to provide \\n`50 crore for this purpose. Besides, a Credit Guarantee Fund will also be created \\nin the Small Farmers’Agri Business Corporation with an initial corpus of `100 \\ncrore. I urge State Governments to support such FPOs through necessary \\namendments to the APMC Act and in other ways. \\nNational Livestock Mission \\n\\n53. The National Livestock Mission will be launched in 2013-14 to attract \\ninvestment and to enhance productivity taking into account local agro-climatic \\nconditions. I propose to provide `307 crore for the Mission. There will be a sub \\nMission for increasing the availability of feed and fodder. \\nFood Security \\n\\n54. Food security is as much a basic human right as the right to education or \\nthe right to health care. The National Food Security Bill is a promise of the UPA \\nGovernment. I sincerely hope that Parliament will pass the Bill as early as \\npossible. Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that I have set apart `10,000 \\ncrore, over and above the normal provision for food subsidy, towards the \\nincremental cost that is likely under the Act. \\n\\x0c\\n9 \\n\\nIV. INVESTMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE AND INDUSTRY \\n55. The growth rate of an economy is correlated with the investment rate. \\nThe key to restart the growth engine is to attract more investment, both from \\ndomestic investors and foreign investors. Investment is an act of faith. We will \\nimprove communication of our policies to remove any apprehension or distrust \\nin the minds of investors, including fears about undue regulatory burden or \\napplication of tax laws. ‘Doing business in India’ must be seen as easy, friendly \\nand mutually beneficial. \\n56. While every sector can absorb new investment, it is the infrastructure \\nsector that needs large volumes of investment. The 12th Plan projects an investment \\nof USD 1 trillion or `55,00,000 crore in infrastructure. The Plan envisages that \\nthe private sector will share 47 percent of the investment. Besides, we need new \\nand innovative instruments to mobilise funds for this order of investment. \\nGovernment has taken or will take the following measures to increase investment \\nin infrastructure: \\n. \\nInfrastructure Debt Funds (IDF) will be encouraged. These funds will \\nraise resources and, through take-out finance, credit enhancement and \\nother innovative means, provide long-term low-cost debt for infrastructure \\nprojects. I am happy to report that four IDFs have been registered with \\nSEBI so far and two of them were launched in the month of February, \\n2013. \\n. \\nIndia Infrastructure Finance Corporation Ltd (IIFCL), in partnership with \\nthe Asian Development Bank, will offer credit enhancement to \\ninfrastructure companies that wish to access the bond market to tap long \\nterm funds. \\n. \\nIn the last two years, a number of institutions were allowed to issue tax \\nfree bonds. They raised `30,000 crore in 2011-12 and are expected to \\nraise about `25,000 crore in 2012-13. I propose to allow some institutions \\nto issue tax free bonds in 2013-14, strictly based on need and capacity to \\nraise money in the market, upto a total sum of `50,000 crore. \\n. \\nMultilateral Development Banks are keen to assist in efforts to promote \\nregional connectivity. Combining the ‘Look East’ policy and the interests \\nof the North Eastern States, I propose to seek the assistance of the World \\nBank and the Asian Development Bank to build roads in the North Eastern \\nStates and connect them to Myanmar. \\n. \\nNABARD operates the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF). \\nRIDF has successfully utilised 18 tranches so far. I propose to raise the \\ncorpus of RIDF-XIX in 2013-14 to `20,000 crore. \\n\\x0c\\n10 \\n\\n. \\nPursuant to the announcement made last year, a sum of `5000 crore will \\nbe made available to NABARD to finance construction of warehouses, \\ngodowns, silos and cold storage units designed to store agricultural \\nproduce, both in the public and the private sectors. This window will \\nalso finance, through the State Governments, construction of godowns \\nby panchayats to enable farmers to store their produce. \\nRoad Construction \\n\\n57. The road construction sector has reached a certain level of maturity. But \\nit faces challenges not envisaged earlier, including financial stress, enhanced \\nconstruction risk and contract management issues, that are best addressed by an \\nindependent authority. Hence, Government has decided to constitute a regulatory \\nauthority for the road sector. Bottlenecks stalling road projects have been \\naddressed and 3,000 kms of road projects in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, \\nMaharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will be awarded in the first six months \\nof 2013-14. \\nCabinet Committee Investment \\n\\n58. Revival of investment in the industrial sector, especially manufacturing, \\nis a key challenge. Many projects are stalled because they are unable to clear \\nregulatory hurdles. The Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) has been set \\nup to monitor investment proposals as well as projects under implementation, \\nincluding stalled projects, and guide decision-making in order to remove \\nbottlenecks and quicken the pace of implementation. Two meetings of the CCI \\nhave been held already and decisions were taken in respect of a number of oil \\nand gas, power, and coal projects. CCI will take up some more projects shortly. \\nNew Investment \\n\\n59. To attract new investment and to quicken the implementation of projects, \\nI propose to introduce an investment allowance for new high value investments. \\nA company investing `100 crore or more in plant and machinery during the \\nperiod 1.4.2013 to 31.3.2015 will be entitled to deduct an investment allowance \\nof 15 percent of the investment. This will be in addition to the current rates of \\ndepreciation. There will be enormous spill-over benefits to small and medium \\nenterprises. \\n60. The National Electronics Policy 2012 is intended to promote manufacture \\nof electronic goods in India. We recognise the pivotal role of semiconductor \\nwafer fabs in the eco-system of manufacture of electronics. I propose to provide \\nappropriate incentives to semiconductor wafer fab manufacturing facilities, \\nincluding zero customs duty for plant and machinery. \\nSavings \\n\\n61. Increasing savings and their optimal allocation for productive uses lead \\nto higher economic growth. After touching a high of 36.8 percent in 2007-08, \\n\\x0c\\n11 \\n\\ngross domestic saving fell by 6 percentage points in 2011-12. The private sector, \\ncomprising households and corporates, remains the main contributor to saving. \\nThe household sector must be incentivised to save in financial instruments rather \\nthan buy gold. Hence, I propose the following measures: \\n\\n. \\nFirstly, the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme will be \\nliberalised to enable the first time investor to invest in mutual \\nfunds as well as listed shares and she can do so, not in one year \\nalone, but in three successive years. The income limit will be \\nraised from `10,00,000 to `12,00,000; \\n. \\nSecondly, a person taking a loan for his first home from a bank or \\na housing finance corporation upto `25,00,000 during the period \\n1.4.2013 to 31.3.2014 will be entitled to an additional deduction \\nof interest of upto `100,000. This will promote home ownership \\nand give a fillip to a number of industries like steel, cement, brick, \\nwood, glass etc. besides jobs to thousands of construction workers. \\n. \\nThirdly, in consultation with RBI, I propose to introduce \\ninstruments that will protect savings from inflation, especially \\nthe savings of the poor and middle classes. These could be \\nInflation Indexed Bonds or Inflation Indexed National Security \\nCertificates. The structure and tenor of the instruments will be \\nannounced in due course. \\nIndustrial Corridors \\n\\n62. The Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) project has made rapid \\nprogress. Plans for seven new cities have been finalised and work on two new \\nsmart industrial cities at Dholera, Gujarat and Shendra Bidkin, Maharashtra will \\nstart during 2013-14. We acknowledge the support of the Government of Japan. \\nIn order to dispel any doubt about funding, I wish to make it clear that we shall \\nprovide, if required, additional funds during 2013-14 within the share of the \\nGovernment of India in the overall outlay for the project. \\n63. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) and the Japan \\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) are currently preparing a comprehensive \\nplan for the Chennai Bengaluru Industrial Corridor. The corridor will be \\ndeveloped in collaboration with the Governments of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh \\nand Karnataka. \\n64. The next corridor will be the Bengaluru Mumbai Industrial Corridor on \\nwhich preparatory work has started. \\nLeh-Kargil Transmission Line \\n\\n65. To improve power supply in the Leh-Kargil region and connect the Ladakh \\nregion to the northern grid, the Government will construct a transmission system \\nfrom Srinagar to Leh at a cost of `1,840 crore. I propose to provide `226 crore \\nin 2013-14 for the project. \\n\\x0c\\n12 \\n\\nPorts \\n\\n66. Two new major ports will be established in Sagar, West Bengal and in \\nAndhra Pradesh to add 100 million tonnes of capacity. In addition, a new outer \\nharbour will be developed in the VOC port at Thoothukkudi, Tamil Nadu through \\nPPP at an estimated cost of `7,500 crore. When completed, this will add 42 \\nmillion tonnes of capacity. \\nNational Waterways \\n\\n67. Five inland waterways have been declared as national waterways. I am \\nhappy to announce that the Minister of Water Resources will move a Bill in \\nParliament to declare the Lakhipur – Bhanga stretch of river Barak in Assam as \\nthe sixth national waterway. Preparatory work is underway to build a grid \\nconnecting waterways, roads and ports. The 12th Plan has an adequate outlay for \\ncapital works, including dredging, on the national waterways. The objective is \\nto choose barge operators, through competitive bidding, to transport bulk cargo \\non the national waterways. The first transport contract has been awarded in \\nWest Bengal from Haldia to Farakka. \\nOil and Gas \\n\\n68. The oil and gas exploration policy will be reviewed to move from profit \\nsharing to revenue sharing contracts. A policy to encourage exploration and \\nproduction of shale gas will be announced. The natural gas pricing policy will \\nbe reviewed and uncertainties regarding pricing will be removed. NELP blocks \\nthat were awarded but are stalled will be cleared. The 5 MMTPA LNG terminal \\nin Dabhol, Maharashtra will be fully operational in 2013-14. \\nCoal \\n\\n69. Despite abundant coal reserves, we continue to import large volumes of \\ncoal. Coal imports during the period April-December, 2012 have crossed 100 \\nmillion tonnes. It is estimated that imports will rise to 185 million tonnes in \\n2016-17. If the coal requirements of the existing power plants and the power \\nplants that will come into operation by 31.3.2015 are taken into account, there is \\nno alternative except to import coal and adopt a policy of blending and pooled \\npricing. In the medium to long term, we must reduce our dependence on imported \\ncoal. One of the ways forward is to devise a PPP policy framework, with Coal \\nIndia Limited as one of the partners, in order to increase the production of coal \\nfor supply to power producers and other consumers. These matters are under \\nactive consideration and the Minister of Coal will announce Government’s \\npolicies in this behalf in due course. \\nPower \\n\\n70. Hon’ble Members are aware that the Government has approved a scheme \\nfor the financial restructuring of DISCOMS to restore the health of the power \\nsector. I would urge State Governments to prepare the financial restructuring \\nplans quickly, sign the MOU, and take advantage of the scheme. \\n\\x0c\\n13 \\n\\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises \\n\\n71. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) have a large share of jobs, \\nproduction and exports. Too many of them do not grow because of the fear of \\nlosing the benefits associated with staying small or medium. To encourage them \\nto grow, I propose that the benefits or preferences enjoyed by them will stay with \\nthem for upto three years after they grow out of the category in which they obtained \\nthe benefit. To begin with, I propose that the non-tax benefits may be made \\navailable to a MSME unit for three years after it graduates to a higher category. \\n72. To provide greater support to MSMEs, I propose to enhance the \\nrefinancing capability of SIDBI from the current level of `5,000 crore to `10,000 \\ncrore per year. \\n73. SIDBI set up the India Microfinance Equity Fund in 2011-12 with \\nbudgetary support of `100 crore to provide equity and quasi-equity to Micro \\nFinance Institutions (MFI). An amount of `104 crore has been committed to 37 \\nMFIs. I have allocated `100 crore to the IME Fund in the budget and I now \\npropose to provide another sum of `100 crore to the Fund. \\n74. The Factoring Act 2011 has been passed by Parliament. I propose to \\nprovide a corpus of `500 crore to SIDBI to set up a Credit Guarantee Fund for \\nfactoring. \\n75. Tool Rooms and Technology Development Centres set up by the Ministry \\nof Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises have done well in extending technology \\nand design support to small businesses. I propose to provide, with World Bank \\nassistance, a sum of `2,200 crore during the 12th Plan period to set up 15 additional \\nCentres. \\n76. Incubators play an important role in mentoring new businesses which \\nstart as a small or medium business. The new Companies Bill obliges companies \\nto spend 2 percent of average net profits under Corporate Social Responsibility \\n(CSR). I am glad to announce that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs will notify \\nthat funds provided to technology incubators located within academic institutions \\nand approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology or Ministry of MSME \\nwill qualify as CSR expenditure. \\nTextiles \\n\\n77. I propose to continue the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS) \\nfor the textile sector in the 12th Plan with an investment target of `151,000 crore. \\nThe major focus would be on modernisation of the powerloom sector. I propose \\nto provide `2,400 crore in 2013-14 for the purpose. \\n78. Textile parks have been set up under Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks \\n(SITP). It is proposed to set up Apparel Parks within the SITPs to house apparel \\nmanufacturing units. To incentivise such Apparel Parks, I propose to allocate \\n\\x0c\\n14 \\n\\n`50 crore to the Ministry of Textiles to provide an additional grant of upto `10 \\ncrore to each Park. \\n\\n79. A new scheme with an outlay of `500 crore called the Integrated \\nProcessing Development Scheme will be implemented in the 12th Plan to address \\nthe environmental concerns of the textile industry, including improving the \\neffluent treatment infrastructure. I propose to provide `50 crore in 2013-14 for \\nthe scheme. \\n80. The handloom sector is in distress. A very large proportion of handloom \\nweavers are women and belong mainly to the backward classes. I propose to \\naccept their demand for working capital and term loans at a concessional interest \\nof 6 percent. 150,000 individual weavers and 1,800 primary cooperative societies \\nwill benefit in 2013-14. I propose to allocate an additional sum of `96 crore in \\n2013-14 to the Ministry of Textiles for interest subvention. \\n81. India has a rich heritage of traditional industries. Khadi, village industries \\nand coir were taken up for development during the 11th Plan under the Scheme \\nof Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI). The 12th Plan has \\nprovided an outlay of `850 crore. I propose to leverage assistance from \\nMultilateral Development Banks to extend SFURTI to 800 clusters during the \\n12th Plan. 400,000 artisans are expected to be benefited. \\nForeign Trade \\n\\n82. I look forward to the changes that will be made to the Foreign Trade \\nPolicy next month and I assure my support to measures that will be taken to \\nboost exports of goods and services. \\nV. FINANCIAL SECTOR \\n83. The financial sector is at the heart of the economy. \\n84. Hon’ble Members are aware that Government constituted the Financial \\nSector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) in 2011. I am informed that \\nthe report will be presented next month. It is our intention to examine the \\nrecommendations and act quickly and decisively so that our financial sector stands \\non sound legal foundations and remains well-regulated, efficient and \\ninternationally competitive. I propose to constitute a Standing Council of Experts \\nin the Ministry of Finance to analyse the international competitiveness of the \\nIndian financial sector, periodically examine the transaction costs of doing \\nbusiness in the Indian market, and provide inputs to Government for necessary \\naction. \\nBanking \\n\\n85. Our public sector banks are well regulated, they must also be adequately \\ncapitalised. Before the end of March, 2013, we shall provide `12,517 crore to \\ninfuse additional capital into 13 public sector banks. In 2013-14, I propose to \\n\\x0c\\n15 \\n\\nprovide a further amount of `14,000 crore for capital infusion. We shall ensure \\nthat public sector banks always meet the Basel III regulations as they come into \\nforce in a phased manner. \\n\\n86. Financial inclusion has made rapid strides. All scheduled commercial \\nbanks and all RRBs are on core banking solution (CBS) and on the electronic \\npayment systems (NEFT and RTGS). We are working with RBI and NABARD \\nto bring all other banks, including some cooperative banks, on CBS and e-payment \\nsystems by 31.12.2013. Public sector banks have assured me that all their \\nbranches will have an ATM in place by 31.3.2014. \\n87. Women are at the head of many banks today, including two public sector \\nbanks, but there is no bank that exclusively serves women. Can we have a bank \\nthat lends mostly to women and women-run businesses, that supports women \\nSHGs and women’s livelihood, that employs predominantly women, and that \\naddresses gender related aspects of empowerment and financial inclusion? I \\nthink we can. I therefore propose to set up India’s first Women’s Bank as a \\npublic sector bank and I shall provide `1,000 crore as initial capital. I hope to \\nobtain the necessary approvals and the banking licence by October, 2013, and I \\ninvite all Hon’ble Members to the inauguration of the bank shortly thereafter. \\n88. The Rural Housing Fund set up through the National Housing Bank is \\nused to refinance lending institutions, including RRBs, that extend loans for \\nrural housing. So far, 400,000 rural families have taken loans. In the last Budget, \\nwe provided `4,000 crore to the Fund. In consultation with RBI, I propose to \\nprovide `6,000 crore to the Rural Housing Fund in 2013-14. \\n89. Similarly, it is proposed to start a fund for urban housing to mitigate the \\nhuge shortage of houses in urban areas. I propose to ask National Housing Bank \\nto set up the Urban Housing Fund and, in consultation with RBI, I propose to \\nprovide `2,000 crore to the Fund in 2013-14. \\nInsurance \\n\\n90. A multi-pronged approach will be followed to increase the penetration \\nof insurance, both life and general, in the country. I have a number of proposals \\nthat have been finalised in consultation with the regulator, IRDA. \\n. \\nInsurance companies will be empowered to open branches in Tier \\nII cities and below without prior approval of IRDA. \\n. \\nAll towns of India with a population of 10,000 or more will have \\nan office of LIC and an office of at least one public sector general \\ninsurance company. I propose to achieve this goal by 31.3.2014. \\n. \\nKYC of banks will be sufficient to acquire insurance policies. \\n\\x0c\\n16 \\n\\n. \\nBanks will be permitted to act as insurance brokers so that the entire \\nnetwork of bank branches will be utilised to increase penetration. \\n. \\nBanking correspondents will be allowed to sell micro-insurance \\nproducts. \\n. \\nGroup insurance products will now be offered to homogenous \\ngroups such as SHGs, domestic workers associations, anganwadi \\nworkers, teachers in schools, nurses in hospitals etc. \\n. \\nThere are about 10,00,000 motor third party claims that are pending \\nbefore Tribunals/Courts. Public sector general insurance companies \\nwill organise adalats to settle the claims and give relief to the affected \\npersons/families. \\n91. The Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill and the PFRDA Bill are before \\nthis House. I sincerely hope that Government and the Opposition can arrive at a \\nconsensus and pass the two Bills in this session. \\n92. The Rashtriya Swasthiya Bima Yojana covers 34 million families below \\nthe poverty line. It will now be extended to other categories such as rickshaw, \\nauto-rickshaw and taxi drivers, sanitation workers, rag pickers and mine workers. \\n93. A comprehensive and integrated social security package for the \\nunorganised sector is a measure that will benefit the poorest and most vulnerable \\nsections of society. The package should include life-cum-disability cover, health \\ncover, maternity assistance and pension benefits. The present schemes such as \\nAABY, JSBY, RSBY, JSY and IGMSY are run by different ministries and \\ndepartments. I propose to facilitate convergence among the various stakeholder \\nministries/departments so that we can evolve a comprehensive social security \\npackage. \\nCapital Market \\n\\n94. I believe that India’s capital market is among the best regulated markets. \\nThis year is SEBI’s silver jubilee year and I offer the regulator our congratulations. \\nA proposal to amend the SEBI Act to strengthen the regulator is under \\nconsideration. \\n95. I have a number of proposals relating to the capital market that have \\nbeen finalised in consultation with SEBI: \\n. \\nThere are many categories of foreign portfolio investors such as \\nFIIs, sub-accounts, QFIs etc. and there are also different avenues \\nand procedures for them. Designated depository participants, \\nauthorised by SEBI, will now be free to register different classes of \\nportfolio investors, subject to compliance with KYC guidelines. \\n. \\nSEBI will simplify the procedures and prescribe uniform registration \\nand other norms for entry of foreign portfolio investors. SEBI will \\n\\x0c\\n17 \\n\\nconverge the different KYC norms and adopt a risk-based approach \\nto KYC to make it easier for foreign investors such as central banks, \\nsovereign wealth funds, university funds, pension funds etc. to invest \\nin India. \\n\\n. \\nIn order to remove the ambiguity that prevails on what is Foreign \\nDirect Investment (FDI) and what is Foreign Institutional Investment \\n(FII), I propose to follow the international practice and lay down a \\nbroad principle that, where an investor has a stake of 10 percent or \\nless in a company, it will be treated as FII and, where an investor \\nhas a stake of more than 10 percent, it will be treated as FDI. A \\ncommittee will be constituted to examine the application of the \\nprinciple and to work out the details expeditiously. \\n. \\nFIIs will be allowed to participate in the exchange traded currency \\nderivative segment to the extent of their Indian rupee exposure in \\nIndia. \\n. \\nFIIs will also be permitted to use their investment in corporate bonds \\nand Government securities as collateral to meet their margin \\nrequirements. \\n. \\nAngel investors bring both experience and capital to new ventures. \\nSEBI will prescribe requirements for angel investor pools by which \\nthey can be recognised as Category I AIF venture capital funds. \\n. \\nSmall and medium enterprises, including start-up companies, will \\nbe permitted to list on the SME exchange without being required \\nto make an initial public offer (IPO), but the issue will be restricted \\nto informed investors. This will be in addition to the existing SME \\nplatform in which listing can be done through an IPO and with \\nwider investor participation. \\n. \\nWith the object of developing the debt market, stock exchanges \\nwill be allowed to introduce a dedicated debt segment on the \\nexchange. Banks and primary dealers will be the proprietary trading \\nmembers. In order to create a complete market, insurance \\ncompanies, provident funds and pension funds will be permitted to \\ntrade directly in the debt segment with the approval of the sectoral \\nregulator. \\n. \\nMutual fund distributors will be allowed to become members in \\nthe Mutual Fund segment of stock exchanges so that they can \\nleverage the stock exchange network to improve their reach and \\ndistribution. \\n. \\nThe list of eligible securities in which Pension Funds and Provident \\nFunds may invest will be enlarged to include exchange traded funds, \\ndebt mutual funds and asset backed securities. \\n\\x0c\\n18 \\n\\nVI. ENVIRONMENT \\n96. India tosses out several thousand tonnes of garbage each day. We will \\nevolve a scheme to encourage cities and municipalities to take up waste-to-energy \\nprojects in PPP mode which would be neutral to different technologies. I propose \\nto support municipalities that will implement waste-to-energy projects through \\ndifferent instruments such as viability gap funding, repayable grant and low cost \\ncapital. \\n97. Clean and Green energy is a priority of the Government. However, despite \\ncost advantages in labour, land and construction, the consumer pays a high price \\nfor renewable energy. One of the reasons is high cost of finance. In order to \\nprovide low cost finance, Government will provide low interest bearing funds \\nfrom the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) to IREDA to on-lend to viable \\nrenewable energy projects. The scheme will have a life span of five years. \\n98. The non-conventional wind energy sector deserves incentives. Hence, I \\npropose to reintroduce ‘generation-based incentive’ for wind energy projects \\nand provide `800 crore to the Ministry of Non Renewable Energy for the purpose. \\nVII. OTHER PROPOSALS \\nBackward Regions Grant Fund \\n\\n99. The Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF) is a vital source of gap \\nfunding. I propose to allocate `11,500 crore in 2013-14 as well as another sum \\nof `1,000 crore for LWE affected districts. BRGF will include a State component \\nfor Bihar, the Bundelkand region, West Bengal, the KBK districts of Odisha and \\nthe 82 districts under the Integrated Action Plan. The present criteria for \\ndetermining backwardness are based on terrain, density of population and length \\nof international borders. It may be more relevant to use a measure like the distance \\nof the State from the national average under criteria such as per capita income, \\nliteracy and other human development indicators. I propose to evolve new criteria \\nand reflect them in future planning and devolution of funds. \\nSkill Development \\n\\n100. Hon’ble Members will recall that in 2008-09 I had proposed the \\nestablishment of the National Skill Development Corporation. The Corporation \\nhas since been set up and has done good work, but there is a long way to go. We \\nhave set an ambitious target of skilling 50 million people in the 12th Plan period, \\nincluding 9 million in 2013-14. We have to pull out all stops to achieve this \\nobjective. Funds will be released by the National Rural Livelihood Mission and \\nthe National Urban Livelihood Mission to be spent on skill development activities. \\n5 percent of the Border Area Development Programme Fund, 10 percent of the \\nSpecial Central Assistance to the Scheduled Caste sub plan and the Tribal sub \\nplan, and some other funds will also be used for skill development. \\n\\x0c\\n19 \\n\\nDefence \\n\\n101. I propose to increase the allocation for Defence to `203,672 crore. This \\nwill include `86,741 crore for capital expenditure. The Minister of Defence has \\nbeen most understanding, and I assure him and the House that constraints will \\nnot come in the way of providing any additional requirement for the security of \\nthe nation. \\nScience & Technology \\n\\n102. Despite our constraints, we must find resources for science and technology \\nand for Space, Atomic Energy etc. I propose to allocate `6,275 crore to the \\nMinistry of Science & Technology; `5,615 crore to the Department of Space; \\nand `5,880 crore to the Department of Atomic Energy. Hon’ble Members will \\nbe happy to know that these amounts are substantial enhancements. \\n103. While we extol the virtues of science and technology (S&T), I think we \\ndo not pay enough attention to science and technology for the common man. \\nWith the help of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Principal \\nScientific Adviser to the Government, I have identified a few amazing S&T \\ninnovations. I propose to set apart `200 crore to fund organisations that will \\nscale up and make these products available to the people. I propose to ask the \\nNational Innovation Council to formulate a scheme for the management and \\napplication of the fund. \\nInstitutions of Excellence \\n\\n104. Continuing the tradition of supporting institutions of excellence, I propose \\nto make a grant of `100 crore each to: \\n. \\nAligarh Muslim University, Aligarh campus \\n. \\nBanaras Hindu University, Varanasi \\n. \\nTata Institute of Social Sciences, Guwahati campus \\n. \\nIndian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) \\nSports \\n\\n105. Sports of all kind deserve our support. We have many sportsmen and \\nsportswomen but few coaches. Hence, I propose to set up the National Institute \\nof Sports Coaching at Patiala at a cost of `250 crore over a period of three years. \\nBroadcasting \\n\\n106. Government proposes to expand private FM radio services to 294 more \\ncities. About 839 new FM radio channels will be auctioned in 2013-14 and, \\nafter the auction, all cities having a population of more than 100,000 will be \\ncovered by private FM radio services. \\nPanchayati Raj \\n\\n107. The Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA) was started \\nin the current year with a modest allocation of `50 crore. Keeping in view the \\n\\x0c\\n20 \\n\\nimportance of building capacity in panchayati raj institutions, I had allocated \\n`455 crore to the Ministry of Panchayati Raj in 2013-14. I propose to provide an \\nadditional `200 crore . \\n\\nPost Offices \\n\\n108. Government has initiated an ambitious IT driven project to modernise \\nthe postal network at a cost of `4,909 crore. Post offices will become part of the \\ncore banking solution and offer real time banking services. I propose to provide \\n`532 crore for the project in 2013-14. \\nGhadar Memorial \\n\\n109. To mark the centenary of the Ghadar movement, the Government will \\nfund the conversion of the Ghadar Memorial in San Francisco into a museum \\nand library. \\nCentral Schemes \\n\\n110. Government is concerned about the proliferation of Centrally Sponsored \\nSchemes (CSS) and Additional Central Assistance (ACA) schemes. They were \\n173 in number at the end of the 11th Plan. I am glad to announce that the schemes \\nwill be restructured into 70 schemes. Each scheme will be reviewed once in two \\nyears. Central funds for the schemes will be given to the States as part of central \\nplan assistance. Hon’ble Members will be glad to know that, in 2013-14, I expect \\nto transfer resources to the tune of `5,87,082 crore to the States and UTs under \\nshare of taxes, non-plan grants and loans, and central assistance. \\nI make three promises \\n\\n111. Madam Speaker, before I close this part of my speech, I wish to draw a \\npicture of three faces that represent the vast majority of the people of India. The \\nfirst is the face of the woman. She is the girl child, the young student, the \\nsportswoman, the homemaker, the working woman, and the mother. The second \\nis the face of the youth. He is impatient, she is ambitious, and both represent the \\naspirations of a new generation. The third is the face of the poor who look to the \\ngovernment for a little help, a scholarship or an allowance or a subsidy or a \\npension. To each of them, on behalf of the Government, the Prime Minister and \\nthe Chairperson of the UPA, I make a promise. \\n112. To the women of India: We have a collective responsibility to ensure the \\ndignity and safety of women. Recent incidents have cast a long, dark shadow on \\nour liberal and progressive credentials. As more women enter public spaces – \\nfor education or work or access to services or leisure – there are more reports of \\nviolence against them. We stand in solidarity with our girl children and women. \\nAnd we pledge to do everything possible to empower them and to keep them \\nsafe and secure. A number of initiatives are under way and many more will be \\ntaken by Government as well as non-government organisations. These deserve \\nour support. As an earnest of our commitment to these objectives, I propose to \\nset up a fund – let us call it the Nirbhaya Fund – and Government will contribute \\n`1,000 crore. Ministry of Women and Child Development and other ministries \\n\\x0c\\n21 \\n\\nconcerned will be requested to work out the details of the structure, scope and \\napplication of the fund. \\n\\n113. To the youth of India: A large number of youth must be motivated to \\nvoluntarily join skill development programmes. I propose to ask the National \\nSkill Development Corporation to set the curriculum and standards for training \\nin different skills. Any institution or body may offer training courses. At the end \\nof the training, the candidate will be required to take a test conducted by authorised \\ncertification bodies. Upon passing the test, the candidate will be given a certificate \\nas well as a monetary reward of an average of `10,000 per candidate. Skill-\\ntrained youth will give an enormous boost to employability and productivity. \\nOn the assumption that 10,00,000 youth can be motivated, I propose to set apart \\n`1,000 crore for this ambitious scheme. I hope that this will be the trigger to \\nextend skill development to all the youth of the country. \\n114. To the poor of India: The Direct Benefit Transfer scheme has captured \\nthe imagination of the people, especially the poor. The Government is the \\ngovernment of the people. The money is the money belonging to the people. \\nWhen we say “Aapka paisa aapke haath”, why should anyone oppose it? We \\nhave made a modest and cautious beginning on the 1st of January, 2013. Nearly \\n11 lakh beneficiaries have received the benefit directly into their bank accounts. \\nAll around us, we see the smiles on the faces of the dalit girls and the tribal boys \\nwho have received their scholarships. We see the happiness on the faces of the \\npregnant women who are assured that the Government cares for the mother and \\nthe child before and after child birth. We are redoubling our efforts to ensure \\nthat the digitized beneficiary lists are available; that a bank account is opened \\nfor each beneficiary; and that the bank account is seeded with Aadhaar in due \\ncourse. I assure the House and the people of India that the DBT scheme will be \\nrolled out throughout the country during the term of the UPA Government. \\nBudget Estimates \\n\\n115. I shall now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2013-14. \\n116. The estimate of Plan Expenditure is placed at `5,55,322 crore. As a \\nproportion of total expenditure, it will be 33.3 percent. \\n117. Non Plan Expenditure is estimated at `11,09,975 crore. \\n118. When we accepted the main recommendations of the Kelkar report, I \\nhad drawn some red lines and promised that I would not cross those lines. I am \\nglad to report that I have kept my promise. The fiscal deficit for the current year \\nhas been contained at 5.2 percent and the fiscal deficit for the year \\n2013-14 is estimated at 4.8 percent. The revenue deficit for the current year will \\nbe 3.9 percent and the revenue deficit for the year 2013-14 is estimated at 3.3 \\npercent. We must redeem our promise by 2016-17 and bring down the fiscal \\ndeficit to 3 percent, the revenue deficit to 1.5 percent and the effective revenue \\ndeficit to zero. \\n\\x0c\\n22 \\n\\nPART B \\n\\nVIII. TAX PROPOSALS \\n119. Madam Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals. \\n120. When I took over in August, 2012, I made a statement that “clarity in tax \\nlaws, a stable tax regime, a non-adversarial tax administration, a fair mechanism \\nfor dispute resolution, and an independent judiciary will provide great assurance”. \\nThat statement is the underlying theme of my tax proposals, both on the direct \\ntaxes side and on the indirect taxes side. \\n121. An emerging economy must have a tax system that reflects best global \\npractices. I propose to set up a Tax Administration Reform Commission to review \\nthe application of tax policies and tax laws and submit periodic reports that can \\nbe implemented to strengthen the capacity of our tax system. \\n122. In 2011-12, the tax GDP ratio was 5.5 percent for direct taxes and 4.4 \\npercent for indirect taxes. These ratios are one of the lowest for any large \\ndeveloping country and will not garner adequate resources for inclusive and \\nsustainable development. I may recall that in 2007-08, the tax GDP ratio touched \\na peak of 11.9 percent. In the short term, we must reclaim that peak. \\nDirect Taxes \\n\\n123. Let me begin with direct taxes. \\n124. In a constrained economy, there is little room to raise tax rates or large \\namounts of additional tax revenues. Equally, there is little room to give away \\ntax revenues or the tax base. It is a time for prudence, restraint and patience. \\n125. The rates of personal income tax have survived four Finance Ministers \\nand four Governments. The current slabs were introduced only last year. Hence, \\nI am afraid, there is no case to revise either the slabs or the rates. Besides, even \\na moderate increase in the level of threshold exemption will mean that hundreds \\nof thousands of tax payers will go out of the tax net and the tax base will be \\nseverely eroded. Nevertheless, I am inclined to give some relief to the tax payers \\nin the first bracket of `2 lakh to `5 lakh. Assuming an inflation rate of 10 percent \\nand a notional rise in the threshold exemption from `2,00,000 to `2,20,000, I \\npropose to provide a tax credit of `2,000 to every person who has a total income \\nupto `5 lakh. 1.8 crore tax payers are expected to benefit to the value of `3,600 \\ncrore. \\n126. Fiscal consolidation cannot be effected only by cutting expenditure. \\nWherever possible, revenues must also be augmented. When I need to raise \\n\\x0c\\n23 \\n\\nresources, who can I go to except those who are relatively well placed in society? \\nThere are 42,800 persons – let me repeat, only 42,800 persons – who admitted to \\na taxable income exceeding `1 crore per year. I propose to impose a surcharge \\nof 10 percent on persons whose taxable income exceeds `1 crore per year. This \\nwill apply to individuals, HUFs, firms and entities with similar tax status. \\n\\n127. I also propose to increase the surcharge from 5 percent to 10 percent on \\ndomestic companies whose taxable income exceeds `10 crore per year. In the \\ncase of foreign companies, who pay the higher rate of corporate tax, the surcharge \\nwill increase from 2 percent to 5 percent. \\n128. In all other cases, such as dividend distribution tax or tax on distributed \\nincome, I propose to increase the current surcharge of 5 percent to 10 percent. \\n129. The additional surcharges will be in force for only one year, that is \\nFinancial Year 2013-14. \\n130. I believe there is a little bit of the spirit of Mr. Azim Premji in every \\naffluent tax payer. I am confident that when I ask the relatively prosperous to \\nbear a small burden for one year, just one year, they will do so cheerfully. \\n131. The education cess for all tax payers shall continue at 3 percent. \\n132. In part A of my speech, I had referred to the tax benefit to the first-home \\nbuyer who takes a loan for an amount not exceeding `25,00,000. I propose to \\nallow such home buyers an additional deduction of interest of `100,000 to be \\nclaimed in AY 2014-15. If the limit is not exhausted, the balance may be claimed \\nin AY 2015-16. This deduction will be over and above the deduction of `150,000 \\nallowed for self-occupied properties under section 24 of the Income-tax Act. \\n133. I propose to relax the eligibility conditions of life insurance policies for \\npersons suffering from disability or certain ailments by increasing the permissible \\npremium rate from 10 percent to 15 percent of the sum assured. This relaxation \\nshall be available in respect of policies issued on or after 1.4.2013. \\n134. Contributions made to the Central Government Health Scheme are eligible \\nfor deduction under section 80D of the Income-tax Act. I propose to extend the \\nsame benefit to similar schemes of the Central Government and State \\nGovernments. \\n135. Donations made to the National Children’s Fund will now be eligible for \\n100 percent deduction. \\n136. No large economy can become truly developed without a robust \\nmanufacturing sector. Hence, as stated in part A of my speech, I propose to \\nprovide an investment allowance at the rate of 15 percent to a manufacturing \\ncompany that invests more than `100 crore in plant and machinery during the \\nperiod 1.4.2013 to 31.3.2015. \\n\\x0c\\n24 \\n\\n137. I propose to extend the ‘eligible date’ for projects in the power sector to \\navail of the benefit under section 80-IA of the Income-tax Act, from 31.3.2013 \\nto 31.3.2014. \\n138. In order to encourage repatriation of funds from overseas companies, I \\npropose to continue for one more year the concessional rate of tax of 15 percent \\non dividend received by an Indian company from its foreign subsidiary. Further, \\nthe Indian company shall not be liable to pay dividend distribution tax on the \\ndistribution to its shareholders of that portion of the income received from its \\nforeign subsidiary. \\n139. With a view to attract investment in long term infrastructure bonds in \\nforeign currency, the rate of tax on interest paid to non-resident investors was \\nreduced last year from 20 percent to 5 percent. I propose to extend the same \\nbenefit to investment made through a designated bank account in rupee-\\ndenominated long term infrastructure bonds. \\n140. In order to facilitate financial institutions to securitise their assets through \\na special purpose vehicle, I propose to exempt the Securitisation Trust from \\nincome tax. Tax shall be levied only at the time of distribution of income by the \\nSecuritisation Trust at the rate of 30 percent in the case of companies and at the \\nrate of 25 percent in the case of an individual or HUF. No further tax will be \\nlevied on the income received by the investors from the Securitisation Trust. \\n141. Investor Protection Fund set up by a depository for the protection of \\ninterest of beneficial owners will be exempt from income tax. \\n142. I propose to provide parity in taxation between an IDF-Mutual Fund that \\ndistributes income and an IDF-NBFC that pays interest, when the payment is \\nmade to a non-resident. The rate of tax on such distributed income or interest \\nwill be 5 percent. \\n143. Venture Capital Funds have been allowed pass through status under the \\nIncome-tax Act. The relevant regulations of SEBI have been replaced by \\nAlternative Investment Fund Regulations. Hence, I propose to extend, subject \\nto certain conditions, pass through status to category I Alternative Investment \\nFunds registered with SEBI as venture capital funds. Angel Investors who are \\nrecognised as category I AIF venture capital funds will also get pass through \\nstatus. \\n144. I propose to modify the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Saving Scheme, details of \\nwhich I had mentioned in part A of my speech. \\n145. Transactions in immovable properties are usually undervalued and \\nunderreported. One-half of the transactions do not carry the PAN of the parties \\nconcerned. With a view to improve the reporting of such transactions and the \\ntaxation of capital gains, I propose to apply TDS at the rate of one percent on the \\n\\x0c\\n25 \\n\\nvalue of the transfer of immovable property where the consideration exceeds \\n`50 lakhs. However, agricultural land will be exempt. \\n\\n146. Some tax avoidance arrangements have come to notice, and I propose to \\nplug the loopholes. Some unlisted companies have avoided dividend distribution \\ntax by arrangements involving buyback of shares. I propose to levy a final \\nwithholding tax at the rate of 20 percent on profits distributed by unlisted \\ncompanies to shareholders through buyback of shares. \\n147. Another case is the distribution of profits by a subsidiary to a foreign \\nparent company in the form of royalty. Besides, the rate of tax on royalty in the \\nIncome-tax Act is lower than the rates provided in a number of Double Tax \\nAvoidance Agreements. This is an anomaly that must be corrected. Hence, I \\npropose to increase the rate of tax on payments by way of royalty and fees for \\ntechnical services to non-residents from 10 percent to 25 percent. However, the \\napplicable rate will be the rate of tax stipulated in the DTAA. \\n148. Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has a stabilizing effect on transactions, \\nalthough it adds to the transaction cost. Taking note of the changes and shifts in \\nthe market, I propose to make the following reductions in the rates of tax: \\nEquity futures: from 0.017 to 0.01 percent \\nMF/ETF redemptions at fund counters: from 0.25 to 0.001 percent \\nMF/ETF purchase/sale on exchanges: from 0.1 to 0.001 percent, only on \\n\\nthe seller \\n\\n149. There is no distinction between derivative trading in the securities market \\nand derivative trading in the commodities market, only the underlying asset is \\ndifferent. It is time to introduce Commodities Transaction Tax (CTT) in a limited \\nway. Hence, I propose to levy CTT on non-agricultural commodities futures \\ncontracts at the same rate as on equity futures, that is at 0.01 percent of the price \\nof the trade. Trading in commodity derivatives will not be considered as a \\n‘speculative transaction’ and CTT shall be allowed as deduction if the income \\nfrom such transaction forms part of business income. As I said, agricultural \\ncommodities will be exempt. \\n150. Hon’ble Members are aware that the Finance Act, 2012 introduced the \\nGeneral Anti Avoidance Rules, for short, GAAR. A number of representations \\nwere received against the new provisions. An expert committee was constituted \\nto consult stakeholders and finalise the GAAR guidelines. After careful \\nconsideration of the report, Government announced certain decisions on \\n14.1.2013 which were widely welcomed. I propose to incorporate those decisions \\nin the Income-tax Act. The modified provisions preserve the basic thrust and \\npurpose of GAAR. Impermissible tax avoidance arrangements will be subjected \\nto tax after a determination is made through a well laid out procedure involving \\n\\x0c\\n26 \\n\\nan assessing officer and an Approving Panel headed by a Judge. I propose to \\nbring the modified provisions into effect from 1.4.2016. \\n\\n151. The Rangachary Committee was appointed to look into tax matters \\nrelating to Development Centres & IT sector and Safe Harbour rules for a number \\nof sectors. We have issued a circular covering IT sector exports and will shortly \\nissue a circular covering Development Centres. Rules on Safe Harbour will be \\nissued after examining the reports of the Committee, the last of which is expected \\nby 31.3.2013. \\n152. The fifth Large Tax payer Unit will be opened at Kolkata shortly. \\n153. I have also taken a number of administrative measures in the last few \\nmonths. I propose to expand the scope of annual information returns, extend e-\\npayment facility through more banks, extend the refund banker system to refunds \\nof more than `50,000, and make e-filing mandatory for more categories of \\nassessees. The Income-tax department is rapidly moving towards technology-\\nbased processing as would be evident from the Central Processing Cell set up at \\nBengaluru and the Central Processing Cell-TDS inaugurated a few days ago at \\nVaishali, Ghaziabad. \\n154. The Direct Taxes Code (DTC) is work in progress. The DTC is not \\nintended to be an amended version of the Income-tax Act, 1961 but a new code \\nbased on the best international practices that will be compatible with the needs \\nof a fast developing economy. The Standing Committee on Finance has submitted \\nits report and we attach great weight to its recommendations. My team in the \\nMinistry of Finance is examining the recommendations and I intend to work \\nwith the Standing Committee and its Chairman in order to finalise the official \\namendments. I shall endeavour to bring the Bill back to this House before the \\nend of the Budget Session. \\nIndirect Taxes \\n\\n155. I shall now deal with indirect taxes. \\n156. There will be no change in the peak rate of basic customs duty of 10 \\npercent for non-agricultural products. There will also be no change in the normal \\nrate of excise duty of 12 percent and the normal rate of service tax of 12 percent. \\n157. I have a few proposals on customs duties. \\n158. To encourage manufacture of environment-friendly vehicles, I propose \\nto extend the period of concession now available for specified parts of electric \\nand hybrid vehicles upto 31.3.2015. \\n159. Leather and leather goods is a thrust sector for exports. I propose to \\nreduce the duty on specified machinery for manufacture of leather and leather \\ngoods, including footwear, from 7.5 percent to 5 percent. \\n\\x0c\\n27 \\n\\n160. To encourage exports, I propose to reduce the duty on pre-forms of \\nprecious and semi-precious stones from 10 percent to 2 percent. \\n161. Export duty on de-oiled rice bran oil cake has made our exports \\nuncompetitive. Hence, I propose to withdraw the said duty. \\n162. Prices of unprocessed ilmenite have gone up several fold in the export \\nmarket. Considering the need to conserve our natural resources, I propose to \\nimpose a duty of 10 percent on export of unprocessed ilmenite and 5 percent on \\nexport of upgraded ilmenite. \\n163. The aircraft manufacture, repair and overhaul (MRO) industry is at a \\nnascent stage. Encouraging the MRO sector will generate employment besides \\nother benefits. Hence, I propose to provide certain concessions to the MRO \\nindustry, details of which are in the budget documents. \\n164. To encourage domestic production of set top boxes as well as value \\naddition, I propose to increase the duty from 5 percent to 10 percent. \\n165. In order to give a measure of protection to domestic sericulture, I propose \\nto increase the duty on raw silk from 5 percent to 15 percent. \\n166. Steam coal is exempt from customs duty but attracts a concessional CVD \\nof one percent. Bituminous coal attracts a duty of 5 percent and CVD of 6 \\npercent. Since both kinds of coal are used in thermal power stations, there is \\nrampant misclassification. I propose to equalise the duties on both kinds of coal \\nand levy 2 percent customs duty and 2 percent CVD. \\n167. There is an affluent class in India that consumes imported luxury goods \\nsuch as high end motor vehicles, motorcycles, yachts and similar vessels. I am \\nsure they will not mind paying a little more. Hence, I propose to increase the \\nduty on such motor vehicles from 75 percent to 100 percent; on motorcycles \\nwith engine capacity of 800cc or more from 60 percent to 75 percent; and on \\nyachts and similar vessels from 10 percent to 25 percent. \\n168. The baggage rules permitting eligible passengers to bring jewellery was \\nlast amended in 1991. Gold prices have risen since, and passengers have \\ncomplained of harrasment. Hence, I propose to raise the duty-free limit to `50,000 \\nin the case of a male passenger and `100,000 in the case of a female passenger, \\nsubject to the usual conditions. \\n169. Next, I shall deal with excise duties. \\n170. The readymade garment industry is in the throes of a crisis. The industry \\nneeds a lifeline. There is a demand to restore the ‘zero excise duty route’ for \\ncotton and manmade sector (spun yarn) at the yarn, fabric and garment stages. I \\n\\x0c\\n28 \\n\\npropose to accept the demand. In the case of cotton, there will be zero duty at \\nthe fibre stage also and, in the case of spun yarn, there will be a duty of 12 \\npercent at the fibre stage. The ‘zero excise duty route’ will be in addition to the \\nCENVAT route now available. \\n\\n171. I propose to totally exempt handmade carpets and textile floor coverings \\nof coir or jute from excise duty. \\n172. As a measure of relief to the ship building industry, I propose to exempt \\nships and vessels from excise duty. Consequently, there will be no CVD on \\nimported ships and vessels. \\n173. What does a Finance Minister turn to when he requires resources? The \\nanswer is cigarettes. I propose to increase the specific excise duty on cigarettes \\nby about 18 percent. Similar increases are proposed on cigars, cheroots and \\ncigarillos. \\n174. SUVs occupy greater road and parking space and ought to bear a higher \\ntax. I propose to increase the excise duty on SUVs from 27 percent to 30 percent. \\nHowever, the increase will not apply to SUVs registered as taxis. \\n175. The excise duty rate on marble was fixed in 1996. Keeping in view the \\nincrease in prices of marble, I propose to increase the duty from `30 per sq. mtr \\nto ` 60 per sq mtr. \\n176. I propose to levy 4 percent excise duty on silver manufactured from \\nsmelting zinc or lead, to bring the rate on par with the excise duty applicable to \\nsilver obtained from copper ores and concentrates. \\n177. About 70 percent of imported mobile phones and about 60 percent of \\ndomestically manufactured mobile phones are priced at `2000 or below. Mobile \\nphones enjoy a concessional excise duty of one percent and I do not propose to \\nchange that in the case of low priced mobile phones. However, on mobile phones \\npriced at more than `2000, I propose to raise the duty to 6 percent. \\n178. To reduce valuation disputes, I propose to provide for MRP based \\nassessment in respect of branded medicaments of Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, \\nHomeopathy and bio-chemic systems of medicine. There will be an abatement \\nof 35 percent. \\n179. As regards service tax, I have only a few proposals. The negative list \\nbecame effective after the last Budget. Stability in the tax regime is important. \\nHence, I propose to include only two services which deserve to be in the negative \\nlist. They are vocational courses offered by institutes affiliated to the State Council \\nof Vocational Training and testing activities in relation to agriculture and \\nagricultural produce. \\n\\x0c\\n29 \\n\\n180. Last year, at the request of the film industry, full exemption of service \\ntax was granted on copyright on cinematography. The industry has now requested \\nto limit the benefit of exemption to films exhibited in cinema halls. I propose to \\naccept the request. \\n181. At present, service tax does not apply to air conditioned restaurants that \\ndo not serve liquor. The distinction is artificial, and I propose to levy service tax \\non all air conditioned restaurants. \\n182. Homes and flats with a carpet area of 2,000 sq.ft. or more or of a value of \\n`1 crore or more are high-end constructions where the component of ‘service’ is \\ngreater. Hence, I propose to reduce the rate of abatement for this class of buildings \\nfrom 75 percent to 70 percent. Existing exemptions from service tax for low \\ncost housing and single residential units will continue. \\n183. While there are nearly 17,00,000 registered assessees under service tax, \\nonly about 7,00,000 file returns. Many have simply stopped filing returns. We \\ncannot go after each of them. I have to motivate them to file returns and pay the \\ntax dues. Hence, I propose to introduce a one-time scheme called ‘Voluntary \\nCompliance Encouragement Scheme’. A defaulter may avail of the scheme on \\ncondition that he files a truthful declaration of service tax dues since 1.10.2007 \\nand makes the payment in one or two instalments before prescribed dates. In \\nsuch a case, interest, penalty and other consequences will be waived. I hope to \\nentice a large number of assessees to return to the tax fold. I also hope to collect \\na reasonable sum of money. \\n184. There are a few more decisions which entail small gains or losses of \\nrevenue. They are reflected in the budget documents. \\n185. My tax proposals on the direct taxes side are estimated to yield `13,300 \\ncrore and on the indirect taxes side `4,700 crore. \\nGoods and Services Tax \\n\\n186. Hon’ble Members will recall that I had first mentioned the Goods and \\nServices Tax (GST) in the Budget speech for 2007-08. At that time, it was \\nthought that GST could be brought into effect from 1.4.2010. Alas, that was not \\nto be, although all States swear by the benefit of GST. However, my recent \\nmeetings with the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers has led me \\nto believe that the State Governments – or, at least, the overwhelming majority – \\nare agreed that there is need for a Constitutional amendment; there is need for \\nState Governments and the Central Government to pass a GST law that will be \\ndrafted by the State Finance Ministers and the GST Council; and there is need \\nfor the Centre to compensate the States for loss due to the reduction in the CST \\nrate. I hope we can take this consensus forward in the next few months and \\nbring to this House a draft Bill on the Constitutional amendment and a draft Bill \\n\\x0c\\n30 \\n\\non GST. Hope inspires courage. I propose to take the first decisive step by \\nsetting apart, in the Budget, a sum of `9,000 crore towards the first instalment of \\nthe balance of CST compensation. I appeal to the State Finance Ministers to \\nrealise the serious intent of the Government to introduce GST and come forward \\nto work with the Government and bring about a transformational change in the \\ntax structure of the country. \\n\\nConclusion \\n\\n187. Madam Speaker, the last day of February is another day in the life of a \\nnation. We pause today, to reflect on the past and the future, and we shall resume \\nour work tomorrow. Our work will be seen in our actions. How shall we act? I \\nturn to my favourite poet, Saint Tiruvalluvar, who said: \\n“Kalangathu Kanda Vinaikkan Thulangkathu \\n\\nThookkang Kadinthu Seyal” \\n\\n(What clearly eye discerns as right, with steadfast will \\n\\nAnd mind unslumbering, that should man fulfil) \\n\\n188. Any economist will tell us what India can become. We are the tenth \\nlargest economy in the world. We can become the eighth, or perhaps the seventh, \\nlargest by 2017. By 2025, we could become a $ 5 trillion economy, and among \\nthe top five in the world. What we will become depends on us and on the choices \\nthat we make. Swami Vivekananda, whose 150th birth anniversary we celebrate \\nthis year, told the people: “All the strength and succour you want is within yourself. \\nTherefore, make your own future.” \\nAs a resolute step towards that future, Madam Speaker, I commend the \\nBudget to the House.', 'Interim Budget 2014-2015 \\n\\nSpeech of \\n\\nP. Chidambaram \\n\\nMinister of Finance \\n\\nFebruary 17, 2014 \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\nINTRODUCTION \\nI rise to present the Interim Budget for 2014-15. \\n\\nThe Current Economic Situation \\n\\n2. As I prepared to write this speech, I found that whether it is a regular Budget for the \\nfull year or an interim Budget, some things remain the same. For example, our goals are the \\nsame and the global context is the same. As I said last year, we are not unaffected by what \\nhappens in the rest of the world. Since September 2008, the state of the world economy has \\nbeen the most decisive factor impacting the fortunes of every developing country. Hence, it is \\npertinent to say a few words on the global economy as well as on the global risks. \\n3. World economic growth was 3.9 percent in 2011, 3.1 percent in 2012 and 3.0 percent \\nin 2013. Those numbers tell the story. Among India’s major trading partners, who are also \\nthe major sources of our foreign capital inflows, the United States has just recovered from a \\nlong recession; Japan’s economy is responding to the stimulus; the Eurozone, as a whole, is \\nreporting a growth of 0.2 percent; and China’s growth has slowed from 9.3 percent in 2011 to \\n7.7 percent in 2013. \\n4. The Global Risks 2014 report has mapped 31 global risks. Of highest concern are ten \\nrisks that include fiscal crisis, structurally high unemployment or underemployment, income \\ndisparity, governance failure, food crisis, and political and social instability. The challenges \\nthat we face are common to all emerging economies. 2012 and 2013 were years of \\nturbulence. Only a handful of countries were able to keep their head above the water, and \\namong them was India. I shall presently give you an account of how we navigated the Indian \\neconomy through this turbulent period. \\nChallenges and Goals \\n\\n5. Within days of my return to the Ministry of Finance, I had declared that our objectives \\nwere fiscal consolidation, price stability, self-sufficiency in food, reviving the growth cycle, \\nenhancing investments, promoting manufacturing, encouraging exports, quickening the pace \\n\\x0c\\nof implementation of projects, and finding practical solutions to certain stressed sectors such \\nas petroleum, power, coal, highways and textiles. \\n\\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY \\nThe Twin Deficits and Inflation \\n\\n6. Let me begin with the good news. The fiscal deficit for 2013-14 will be contained at \\n4.6 percent of GDP, well below the red line that I had drawn last year. More importantly, \\nthe Current Account Deficit, that threatened to exceed last year’s CAD of USD 88 billion, \\nwill be contained at USD 45 billion, and I am happy to inform the House that we expect to \\nadd about USD 15 billion to the foreign exchange reserves by the end of the financial year. \\nAnalysts and rating agencies had acknowledged our efforts some months ago and no longer \\nspeak about a downgrade. I hope that domestic experts will now agree that the UPA \\nGovernment meant what it said when it put fiscal stability at the top of the agenda. Going \\nforward, I appeal to all political parties to join me in the pledge that we shall not – we shall \\nnever – do anything that will affect the stability of the foundations of India’s economy. \\n7. Last year, when I read the Budget speech, WPI headline inflation stood at 7.3 percent \\nand core inflation at 4.2 percent. Through the year, inflation saw its ups and downs. At the \\nend of January 2014, WPI inflation was 5.05 percent and core inflation 3.0 percent. Both the \\nGovernment and the RBI have acted in tandem. While our efforts have not been in vain, \\nthere is still some distance to go. Food inflation is still the main worry, although it has \\ndeclined sharply from a high of 13.6 percent to 6.2 percent. \\nAgriculture \\n\\n8. We are proud of the stellar performance of the agriculture sector. Foodgrain \\nproduction in 2012-13 was 255.36 million tonnes and the estimate for the current year is 263 \\nmillion tonnes. Estimates of production of sugarcane, cotton, pulses, oilseeds and quality \\nseeds point to new records. Agriculture exports in 2012-13 stood at USD 41 billion versus \\nimports of USD 20 billion. In 2013-14, agriculture exports are likely to cross USD 45 \\nbillion. Agricultural credit is likely to touch `735,000 crore, exceeding the target of `700,000 \\ncrore. Agricultural GDP growth increased to 3.1 percent in the five year period of \\nUPA-I and further to 4.0 percent in the first four years of UPA-II. In the current year, \\nagricultural GDP growth is estimated at 4.6 percent. \\nInvestment \\n\\n9. Even after the slowdown, the savings rate was 31.3 percent in 2011-12 and 30.1 \\npercent in 2012-13. The corresponding investment rate was 35.5 percent and 34.8 percent, \\nrespectively, indicating there was no steep decline in investment, except in mining and \\nmanufacturing. If the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) had remained more or less the \\nsame, the outcome should have been a growth rate higher than the 6.7 percent and the 4.5 \\npercent reported so far by the CSO for the two years, but that did not happen. It was obvious \\nthat projects were not achieving commercial operation date (COD) and there were too many \\nobstacles on the path of implementation. At a time when it appeared that a number of \\nprojects would fail because of the logjam, Government took the bold step to set up the \\nCabinet Committee on Investment and the Project Monitoring Group. Thanks to the swift \\ndecisions taken by them, by the end of January, 2014, the way was cleared for completing \\n296 projects with an estimated project cost of `660,000 crore. \\n\\x0c\\nForeign Trade \\n\\n10. Exports have recovered sharply, and the recovery must be seen in the context of \\ngrowth of global trade declining from 6.1 percent in 2011 to 2.7 percent in 2013. India’s \\nmerchandise exports reached a level of USD 300.4 billion in 2012-13 registering a negative \\ngrowth of 1.8 percent over the previous year. Though 2013-14 began on a pessimistic note, I \\nam happy to inform the House that the year will end with estimated merchandise exports of \\nUSD 326 billion, indicating a growth rate of 6.3 percent. However, imports are down, and \\nthis does not augur well for either manufacturing or domestic trade. Our aim must be robust \\ngrowth in both exports and imports, with trade in balance over a period of time. \\nManufacturing \\n\\n11. Manufacturing is the Achilles’ heel of the Indian economy. The deceleration in \\ninvestment in manufacturing is particularly worrying. Consequently, there is no uptick yet in \\nmanufacturing. The National Manufacturing Policy has set the goal of increasing the share of \\nmanufacturing in GDP to 25 percent and to create 100 million jobs over a decade. Eight \\nNational Investment and Manufacturing Zones (NIMZ) have been announced along the \\nDelhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and nine projects have been approved by the DMIC Trust. \\nFive NIMZs outside DMIC have also been given in-principle approval. Three more corridors \\nconnecting Chennai and Bengaluru, Bengaluru and Mumbai, and Amritsar and Kolkata are \\nunder different stages of preparatory work. Additional capacities are being installed in major \\nmanufacturing industries such as steel, cement, refinery, power and electronics. Several \\nmeasures have been taken to promote micro, small and medium enterprises including \\nnotifying a public procurement policy, establishing technology centres and common facility \\ncentres, and launching the Khadi mark. \\nInfrastructure \\n\\n12. We have given a big push to infrastructure and capacity addition in infrastructure \\nindustries. In 2012-13 and in the nine months of the current financial year, we have added \\n29,350 megawatts of power capacity, 3,928 kilometres of national highways, 39,144 \\nkilometres of rural roads under PMGSY, 3,343 kilometres of new railway track, and 217.5 \\nmillion tonnes of capacity per annum in our ports. Besides, 19 oil and gas blocks were given \\nout for exploration and 7 new airports are under construction. We have also facilitated \\nInfrastructure Debt Funds to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects and ease the \\npressure on the banking system. \\nExchange Rate \\n\\n13. Risks to capital flows were accentuated due to volatile global conditions and the \\nindication, in May 2013, of a reduction in asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve. The \\nrupee came under pressure. Government, RBI and SEBI undertook a number of measures to \\nfacilitate capital inflows and stabilise the foreign exchange market. Among emerging \\neconomy currencies, the rupee was affected least when the actual reduction took place in \\nDecember 2013 and January 2014. \\nGDP Growth – Decline and Rise \\n\\n14. Hon’ble Members will recall that the slowdown began in 2011-12. In nine quarters, \\nthe GDP growth rate declined from 7.5 percent in Q1 of 2011-12 to 4.4 percent in Q1 of \\n\\x0c\\n2013-14. Thanks to the numerous measures that I have narrated, I was confident that the \\ndecline will be arrested and the growth cycle will turn in the second quarter. I believe I have \\nbeen vindicated. Growth in Q2 of 2013-14 has been placed at 4.8 percent and growth for the \\nwhole year has been estimated at 4.9 percent. This means that growth in Q3 and Q4 of 201314 \\nwill be at least 5.2 percent. \\n\\n15. I can confidently assert that the economy is more stable today than what it was two \\nyears ago. The fiscal deficit is declining, the current account deficit has been contained, \\ninflation has moderated, the quarterly growth rate is on the rise, the exchange rate is stable, \\nexports have increased, and hundreds of projects have been unblocked. \\n16. Madam Speaker, all this is the result of hard work. I may add, among other mentors, \\nmy mother and Harvard taught me the value of hard work. \\nUPA’s Record of Growth \\n\\n17. Over the last ten years, the UPA Governments have gently nudged India and Indians \\ninto accepting that growth is an imperative; that it must be made more inclusive and \\nconverted into development; and that the growth model, in order to be sustainable, must \\naddress other concerns such as environment, inter-generational equity, indebtedness, \\nownership and control of resources, financing etc. \\n18. The UPA Governments’ record on growth is unparalleled. \\n19. Ten years ago, we produced 213 million tonnes of food grains; today, we produce 263 \\nmillion tonnes of food grains. Ten years ago, the installed power capacity was 112,700 MW; \\ntoday, it is 234,600 MW. Ten years ago, coal production was 361 million tonnes per year; \\ntoday, we produce 554 million tonnes per year. Ten years ago, there were 51,511 km of rural \\nroads under PMGSY; today, we have 389,578 km. Ten years ago, the Central Government’s \\nexpenditure on education was `10,145 crore; this year, we allocated `79,451 crore. Ten \\nyears ago, the Central Government spent `7,248 crore on health; this year, it will spend \\n`36,322 crore. I could multiply the examples, but what I have given will suffice. \\n20. Madam Speaker, I reject the argument of policy paralysis. Just as there are business \\ncycles, there is a cycle around the trend growth rate of an economy. Over a period of 33 \\nyears, the trend growth rate in India has been 6.2 percent. Average annual GDP growth \\nduring the period 1999-2004 was 5.9 percent, that is below the trend rate. In the next five \\nyear period 2004-2009, it was 8.4 percent and, in the period 2009-2014, going by the CSO’s \\nestimate, it will be 6.6 percent. UPA-I and UPA-II have delivered above the trend growth \\nrate. \\n21. Let history be the judge of the last ten years. \\nREPORT CARD OF 2013-14 \\n22. I owe a duty to my colleagues to report on some of the major achievements in the \\ncurrent financial year that concerns the economy of the country and the welfare of the people. \\nWe are not simply looking back, we are actually looking forward, and therefore I shall also \\nreport on the initiatives that are being taken by my colleagues. \\nPath-breaking Decisions \\n\\n23. Government took several notable decisions including some that were described as \\ncourageous and long overdue. Sugar was fully decontrolled. A gradual correction of diesel \\n\\x0c\\nprices was started. Railway fares were rationalised for the first time in a decade. \\nApplications were invited for issue of new bank licences. DISCOMS, mostly sick, are being \\nrestructured with generous Central assistance. \\n\\nHistoric Legislations \\n\\n24. 12.8 lakh land titles covering 18.80 lakh hectare were distributed under the Scheduled \\nTribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act. \\n25. The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, \\nRehabilitation and Resettlement Act was notified on 1.1.2014, finally putting to rest an \\noppressive colonial law of 1894. \\n26. The National Food Security Act was passed assuring foodgrain to 67 percent of the \\npopulation. \\n27. The new Companies Act replaced a law of 1956 vintage. \\n28. The PFRDA Act was passed placing the New Pension System on a statutory basis and \\nestablishing a statutory regulator. \\nEconomic Initiatives \\n\\n29. Centrally Sponsored Schemes were restructured into 66 programmes for greater \\nsynergy. Funds under these programmes will be released as Central assistance to State plans, \\nthus giving States greater authority and responsibility. As a result, Central assistance to plans \\nof States and Union Territories will rise substantially from `136,254 crore in BE 2013-14 to \\n`338,562 crore in 2014-15. \\n30. Public sector enterprises will achieve a new record in capital expenditure of `257,641 \\ncrore in 2013-14. \\n31. About 50,000 MW of thermal and hydel power capacity is under construction after \\nreceiving all clearances and approvals. 78,000 MW of power capacity has been assured coal \\nsupply. \\n32. The FDI policy was liberalized to attract larger investments in telecommunication, \\npharmaceuticals, civil aviation, power trading exchanges and multi-brand retail. \\n33. Approval was granted to establish two semi-conductor wafer fab units that will be the \\nbedrock of the electronics hardware industry. \\n34. The IT modernisation project of the Department of Posts, with an outlay of `4,909 \\ncrore, will be operational by 2015 in all 155,000 locations. \\n35. The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant Unit I achieved criticality and is generating \\n180 million units of power. The 500 MW prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam is \\nnearing completion. Seven nuclear power reactors are under construction with the aim of \\nachieving an installed capacity of 10,080 MW by the end of the Twelfth Plan. \\n\\x0c\\n36. After exceeding the target and achieving 1,684 MW of grid connected solar power, \\nthe National Solar Mission entered the second phase on 1.4.2013. It is proposed to take up \\nfour ultra mega solar power projects each with a capacity of over 500 MW in 2014-15. \\n37. Ministry of MSME will create the ‘India Inclusive Innovation Fund’ to promote \\ngrassroot innovations with social returns to support enterprises in the MSME sector. \\npropose to make an initial contribution of `100 crore to the corpus of the Fund. \\nSocial Sector Initiatives \\n\\n38. In order to promote entrepreneurship among the scheduled castes and to provide \\nconcessional finance to them, IFCI will set up a Venture Capital Fund for Scheduled Castes. \\nI propose to provide an initial capital of `200 crore, which can be supplemented every year. \\n39. The restructured ICDS has been implemented in 400 districts and will be rolled out in \\nthe remaining districts from 1.4.2014. \\n40. Government has approved the National Agro-Forestry Policy 2014 which has multiple \\nobjectives including employment, productivity, conservation and adaptation. \\n41. A mechanism for marketing minor forest produce has been introduced, and the \\nBudget has allocated `444.59 crore to continue the scheme in 2014-15. \\n42. A new plan scheme with an allocation of `100 crore has been approved to promote \\ncommunity radio stations. \\n43. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has delivered new technologies to the people: \\nthe JE vaccine, a diagnostic test for Thalassaemia, and a Magnivisualizer for detection of \\ncervical cancer. \\nAdditional Central Assistance to some States \\n\\n44. The North Eastern States, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand deserve special \\nattention. In addition to funds allocated in the current year, I propose to release a sum of \\n`1,200 crore as Additional Central Assistance to these States before the end of the year. \\nSpace \\n\\n45. India joined a handful of countries when it launched the Mars Orbiter Mission. We \\nnow have the capability in launch vehicle technology, cryogenics, and navigation, \\nmeteorological and communication satellites, and are largely self-reliant. Several flight tests, \\nnavigational satellites and space missions are planned for 2014-15. \\nRedeeming Our Promises \\n\\n46. Last year, I had made three promises and I had asked Hon’ble Members to keep \\nbefore them the faces of the girl child, the young student, and the poor. To ensure the dignity \\nand safety of women, I promised the Nirbhaya Fund and put `1000 crore into the Fund. So \\nfar, we have approved two proposals that will receive support from the Fund. In order to \\nmake it clear that the Fund will be a permanent fund, I intend to declare the grant of `1000 \\ncrore as non-lapsable. And in order to support more proposals, I propose to contribute to the \\nFund another sum of `1000 crore next year. \\n47. Secondly, I had promised an ambitious programme to skill millions of young men and \\nwomen and had tasked the National Skill Development Corporation to implement the \\nprogramme. The National Skill Certification and Monetary Reward Scheme was launched in \\n\\x0c\\nAugust 2013 and has been widely hailed as a success. At last count, 24 Sector Skill Councils, \\n442 Training Partners and 17 Assessment Agencies had joined the programme. 204 job roles \\nhave been finalised. 168,043 youth had enrolled and 77,710 have completed their training. \\nHon’ble Members will recall that I had set apart `1,000 crore for the scheme. The whole of \\nthat amount will be transferred to the NSD Trust and I propose to transfer another sum of \\n`1,000 crore next year to enable the Trust to scale up the programme of NSDC rapidly. \\nmay add that NSDC actually complements the initiatives of several ministries which steer \\nskill development programmes such as UDAAN in Jammu and Kashmir. \\n\\n48. Thirdly, I had promised that the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme would be rolled out \\nthroughout the country. The scheme is barely a year old. Money is being transferred to \\nbeneficiaries under 27 identified schemes, including the National Social Assistance \\nProgramme (NSAP). A total of 54,20,114 transactions have been put through until 31.1.2014 \\nand `628 crore has been transferred. Another sum of `3,370 crore has been transferred to 2.1 \\ncrore LPG beneficiaries. The latter scheme has been put on hold for the time being pending \\nresolution of some difficulties that have been pointed out. However, let me reiterate that the \\nGovernment remains fully committed to Aadhaar under which 57 crore unique numbers have \\nbeen issued so far and to opening bank accounts for all Aadhaar holders in order to promote \\nfinancial inclusion. Who needs Aadhaar? It is those who are at the bottom of the pyramid, \\nthe poor, the migrant workers, the homeless, and the oppressed who need Aadhaar, and we \\nwill ensure that they get Aadhaar. I have no doubt that in course of time even critics of \\nAadhaar will realise that Aadhaar is a tool of empowerment. \\nOVERVIEW OF THE INTERIM BUDGET \\nPlan and Non-Plan Expenditure \\n\\n49. I shall now give an overview of the interim Budget. In some years, we over-provide \\nin the Budget. In those years savings are inevitable. Besides, if there is lower-than-expectedgrowth \\nthere will be lower-than-estimated-revenues as well. 2013-14 has been one such year. \\nI am afraid, we will not be able to spend the budgeted plan expenditure, but non-plan \\nexpenditure will exceed the budget by a small amount. \\n50. In order to sustain the pace of plan expenditure, I have decided to keep plan \\nexpenditure in 2014-15 at the same level at which it was budgeted in 2013-14. I have \\nprovided `555,322 crore for plan expenditure. I am glad to inform the House that all the \\nministries/departments that run key flagship programmes of the UPA Government have been \\nprovided adequate funds. In all the following cases, I have provided in 2014-15 an amount \\nequal to or higher than in the BE of 2013-14 and irrespective of the revised estimates for the \\nyear: \\nMinistry of Minority Affairs .. ` \\n3,711 crore \\nMinistry of Tribal Affairs .. ` \\n4,379 crore \\nMinistry of Housing & Poverty Alleviation .. ` \\n6,000 crore \\nMinistry of Social Justice & Empowerment .. ` \\n6,730 crore \\nMinistry of Panchayati Raj .. ` \\n7,000 crore \\nMinistry of Drinking Water & Sanitation .. ` \\n15,260 crore \\nMinistry of Women & Child Development .. ` \\n21,000 crore \\nMinistry of Health & Family Welfare .. ` \\n33,725 crore \\n\\n\\x0c\\nMinistry of Human Resource Development .. ` \\n67,398 crore \\nMinistry of Rural Development .. ` \\n82,202 crore \\n\\nRailways \\n\\n51. My colleague, the Minister of Railways, presented the Railway Budget a few days \\nago. Budgetary support to Railways has been increased from `26,000 crore in BE 2013-14 to \\n`29,000 crore in 2014-15. Railways need to mobilise huge resources through market \\nborrowing and private public partnership (PPP) schemes. It is proposed to identify new \\ninstruments and new mechanisms to raise funds for railway projects. \\nSC Sub-Plan and Tribal Sub-Plan, \\nGender Budget and Child Budget \\n\\n52. Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that I propose to allocate `48,638 crore to \\nthe scheduled caste sub-plan and `30,726 crore to the tribal sub-plan. They will also be \\nhappy to find that the gender budget has `97,533 crore and the child budget has `81,024 \\ncrore. \\n53. I am confident that there will be no cause for complaint. If there are any \\nshortcomings, they can be addressed when the regular budget is presented. There is enough \\nflexibility in the expenditure budget to make necessary changes in the allocations within the \\noverall resource envelope. \\n54. Non-plan expenditure in 2014-15 is estimated at `12,07,892 crore. Of this, the \\nexpenditure on subsidies for food, fertilizer and fuel will be `246,397 crore. This is slightly \\nmore than the revised estimate of `245,452 crore in 2013-14. For fuel subsidy, I have \\nprovided `65,000 crore. We have, this year, absorbed the rollover of `45,000 crore from the \\nfourth quarter of 2012-13 and we will rollover only `35,000 crore from the fourth quarter of \\nthis year into the next year. `115,000 crore has been allocated for food subsidy keeping in \\nmind our Government’s firm and irrevocable commitment to implement the National Food \\nSecurity Act throughout the country. \\nDefence \\n\\n55. The allocation for defence has been enhanced by 10 percent from `203,672 crore in \\nBE 2013-14 to `224,000 crore in 2014-15. \\nOne Rank One Pension \\n\\n56. Hon’ble Members are aware of the long standing demand of the Defence Services for \\nOne Rank One Pension (OROP). It is an emotive issue, it has legal implications, and it has to \\nbe handled with great sensitivity. During the tenure of the UPA Governments, changes in \\nthe pension rules applicable to the defence services were notified on three occasions in 2006, \\n2010 and 2013. As a result, the gap between pre-2006 retirees and post-2006 retirees has \\nbeen closed in four ranks (subject to some anomalies that are being addressed): Havildar, \\nNaib Subedar, Subedar and Subedar Major. There is still a small gap in the ranks of Sepoy \\nand Naik and a gap in the ranks of Major and above. We need a young fighting force, we \\nneed young jawans, and we need young officers. We also need to take care of those who \\nserved in the defence forces only for a limited number of years. Government has therefore \\ndecided to walk the last mile and close the gap for all retirees in all ranks. I am happy to \\nannounce that Government has accepted the principle of One Rank One Pension for the \\n\\x0c\\ndefence forces. This decision will be implemented prospectively from the financial year \\n2014-15. The requirement for 2014-15 is estimated at `500 crore and, as an earnest of the \\nUPA Government’s commitment, I propose to transfer a sum of `500 crore to the Defence \\nPension Account in the current financial year itself. \\n\\nCentral Armed Police Forces \\n\\n57. A modernisation plan at a cost of `11,009 crore has been approved to strengthen the \\ncapacity of Central Armed Police Forces and to provide them state-of-the-art equipment and \\ntechnology. Funds have been provided in the current financial year and for the next year. \\nFINANCIAL SECTOR \\nBanking \\n\\n58. Hon’ble Members, the announcements that I made concerning the financial sector in \\nthe Budget speech of February 2013 have been, or are being, implemented. In 2014-15, I \\npropose to provide `11,200 crore for capital infusion in public sector banks. They have \\nopened 5,207 branches so far, against the target of 8,023 branches, and are near the goal of \\ninstalling an ATM at every branch. The Bharatiya Mahila Bank was inaugurated on \\n19.11.2013. `6,000 crore was provided to the Rural Housing Fund and `2,000 crore to the \\nUrban Housing Fund. \\n59. Banks are under strain owing to rising non-performing assets. Bankers have assured \\nme that as the economy turns they will be able to contain the NPAs, recover more loans, and \\nbuild healthier balance sheets. \\n60. Meanwhile, I cannot fail to acknowledge the yeomen service rendered by our banks in \\nreaching Government’s policies and programmes to the people. This year, banks will exceed \\nthe target of `700,000 crore of agricultural credit. I am therefore encouraged to set a target of \\n`800,000 crore for 2014-15. Hon’ble Members will recall that an interest subvention scheme \\nwas introduced in 2006-07. There is a subvention of 2 percent and an incentive of 3 percent \\nfor prompt payment, thus reducing the effective rate of interest on farm loans to \\n4 percent. So far, `23,924 crore has been released under the scheme. I propose to continue \\nthe scheme in 2014-15. \\nCredit to Minority Communities \\n\\n61. Ten years ago, the minorities had 14,15,000 bank accounts in 121 districts of India \\nwhere there is a concentration of minorities. At the end of March, 2013, they had 43,52,000 \\naccounts and the volume of lending had soared from `4,000 crore to `66,500 crore. Loans to \\nminority communities in the whole country stood at `211,451 crore at the end of December \\n2013. \\nSelf Help Groups \\n\\n62. Ten years ago, only 9,71,182 women Self-Help Groups had been credit linked to \\nbanks. At the end of December 2013, 41,16,000 women SHGs had been provided credit and \\nthe outstanding amount of credit was `36,893 crore. \\n\\x0c\\nEducation Loans \\n\\n63. Ten years ago, only a few thousand students – mostly the well-connected – got \\neducation loans. At the end of December 2013, public sector banks had 25,70,254 student \\nloan accounts and the amount outstanding was `57,700 crore. \\n64. Hon’ble Members will recall that my predecessor, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, had, in the \\nBudget of 2009-10, introduced the Central Scheme for Interest Subsidy (CSIS) in respect of \\neducation loans disbursed after 1.4.2009 under which Government took over the burden of \\ninterest for the duration of the period of study and a little beyond. The scheme brought great \\ncheer to student-borrowers and their families. However, I have noticed a sense of \\ndiscrimination among students who had borrowed before 31.3.2009, struggled to pay interest \\nduring the period of study, and continued to service the loans afterwards. I think they deserve \\nsome relief. I therefore propose a moratorium period for all education loans taken up to \\n31.3.2009 and outstanding on 31.12.2013. Government will take over the liability for \\noutstanding interest as on 31.12.2013, but the borrower would have to pay interest for the \\nperiod after 1.1.2014. It is estimated that nearly 9 lakh student borrowers will benefit to the \\ntune of approximately `2,600 crore. I intend to provide the funds in the current financial year \\nitself. Accordingly, a sum of `2,600 crore will be transferred to the Canara Bank, the \\ndesignated CSIS banker. Details of the scheme will be announced shortly. \\nInsurance \\n\\n65. This year, Life Insurance Corporation has opened 1,252 offices and the four public \\nsector general insurance companies have opened 1,849 offices in towns with a population of \\n10,000 or more to serve peri-urban and rural areas. They are moving steadily to achieve the \\ngoals set for them. \\nFinancial Markets \\n\\n66. A number of steps have been envisaged to deepen the Indian financial markets. \\nAmong them are \\n• To comprehensively revamp the ADR/GDR scheme and enlarge the scope of \\nDepository Receipts; \\n• To liberalise the rupee-denominated corporate bond market; \\n• To deepen and strengthen the currency derivatives market to enable Indian \\ncompanies to fully hedge against foreign currency risks; \\n• To create one record for all financial assets of every individual; \\n• To enable smoother clearing and settlement for international investors looking \\nto invest in Indian bonds. \\nCommodity Derivatives Market \\n\\n67. Hon’ble Members will recall the payment crisis in the National Spot Exchange \\nLimited (NSEL). Following the transfer of the subject to the Ministry of Finance, swift \\naction was taken to sequester NSEL and to ensure there was no spill over of the crisis to the \\nother regulated segments of the financial market. I propose to amend the Forward Contracts \\n(Regulation) Act to strengthen the regulatory framework of the commodity derivatives \\nmarket. \\n\\x0c\\nKey Pending Bills \\n\\n68. I regret to record my disappointment that the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill and \\nthe Securities Laws (Amendment) Bill have not been passed by Parliament for reasons that \\nhave nothing to do with the merits of the Bills. \\nPublic Debt Management Agency \\n\\n69. Pursuant to the announcement in the Budget speech of 2011-12, Government is ready \\nwith the Public Debt Management Agency Bill. Following precedent, it is proposed to \\nestablish a non-statutory PDMA that can begin work in 2014-15. \\nA VISION FOR THE FUTURE \\n\\n70. Madam Speaker, I now wish to look forward and outline a vision for the future. \\n71. I wonder how many have noted the fact that India’s economy, in terms of the size of \\nits GDP, is the 11th largest in the world. There are great things in store. There is a well-\\nargued view that in the next three decades India’s nominal GDP will take the country to the \\nthird rank after the US and China. Just as the fortunes of the developed countries affect the \\nemerging economies today, the fortunes of China and India will, in the future, have a \\nsignificant impact on the rest of the world. We therefore owe a responsibility not only to \\nourselves but to the whole world to keep our economy in robust health. \\n72. The UPA Government has a clear line of sight to the goals that we have set for \\nourselves. I have broken down the steps toward those goals into tasks that must be \\nundertaken by the Government of the day. I crave your leave to identify ten such tasks: \\ni. Fiscal Consolidation: We must achieve the target of fiscal deficit of 3 percent \\nof GDP by 2016-17, and remain below that level always. \\nii. Current Account Deficit: Since we will run a Current Account Deficit every \\nyear for some more years, it can be financed only by foreign investment, \\nwhether it is FDI or FII or ECB or any other kind of foreign inflow. Hence, \\nthere is no room for any aversion to foreign investment. \\niii. Price Stability and Growth: In a developing economy we must accept that when \\nour aim is high growth there will be a moderate level of inflation. RBI must \\nstrike a balance between price stability and growth while formulating monetary \\npolicy. \\niv. Financial Sector Reforms: The recommendations of the Financial Sector \\nLegislative Reforms Commission that require no change in legislation must be \\nimplemented immediately and, for the other recommendations, we must draw a \\ntimetable for passing legislation. \\nv. Infrastructure: We must rebuild our infrastructure and add a huge quantity of \\nnew infrastructure. Every proven model must be adopted and the PPP model \\nmust be more widely used. New financing structures must be created for long \\nterm funds and pooling of investments. \\nvi. Manufacturing: We must focus on manufacturing and especially on \\nmanufacturing for export. I propose that all taxes, Central and State, that go \\ninto an exported product should be waived or rebated. I also propose that there \\n\\x0c\\nshould be a minimum tariff protection so that there is an incentive to \\nmanufacture goods in India rather than import them into India. \\n\\nvii. Subsidies: Given the limited resources, and the many claims on the resources, \\nwe must choose the subsidies that are absolutely necessary and give them only \\nto the absolutely deserving. \\nviii. Urbanisation: Our cities will become ungovernable, and perhaps unliveable, if \\nwe do not address the decay in our cities. Cities have wealth, cities also create \\nwealth. That wealth should be tapped for resources to rebuild the cities with a \\nnew model of governance. \\nix. Skill Development: Skill development must rank alongside secondary \\neducation, university education, total sanitation and universal health care in the \\npriorities of the Government. \\nx. Sharing responsibility between States and Centre: States have the fiscal space \\nto bear a reasonable proportion of the financial costs of implementing flagship \\nprogrammes and must willingly do so, so that the Central Government can \\nallocate more resources for subjects such as defence, railways, national \\nhighways and telecommunications that are its exclusive responsibility. \\nREVENUES \\nGST and DTC \\n\\n73. Revenues are of paramount importance. The best source of revenue is taxes and for \\nthat we need modern tax laws. I am disappointed that we have not yet been able to introduce \\nGST. I leave it to you to answer the question, who blocked the GST when an agreement on \\nthe game-changing tax reform was around the corner? We have also got ready a Direct Taxes \\nCode that will serve us for at least the next twenty years. I intend to place it on the website \\nfor a public discussion without partisanship or acrimony. I appeal to all political parties to \\nresolve to pass the GST laws and the DTC in 2014-15. \\nFunding Scientific Research \\n\\n74. Our Government has passionately espoused the cause of science, promoted scientific \\nresearch, and supported scientific applications and inventions. The Income-tax Act allows \\ndeductions for expenditure on scientific research, but it is limited to direct funding. We have \\nreflected on a new approach to funding scientific research. I therefore propose to set up a \\nResearch Funding Organisation that will fund research projects selected through a \\ncompetitive process. Contributions to that organisation will be eligible for tax benefits. This \\nwill require legislative changes which can be introduced at the time of the regular Budget. \\nOff-shore Accounts \\n\\n75. There has been much debate on illegal off-shore accounts held by Indians. \\nInvestigations into such accounts were launched in 2011. Despite several hurdles in \\nobtaining evidence from the countries concerned, the Government has succeeded, through \\nalternative methods and special efforts, in obtaining information in 67 cases and action is \\nunderway to determine the tax liability as well as impose penalty. Prosecutions for wilful tax \\nevasion have been launched in 17 other cases. More enquiries have been initiated into \\naccounts reportedly held by Indian entities in no tax or low tax jurisdictions. \\n\\x0c\\nChanges in Tax Rates \\n\\n76. In keeping with the conventions, I do not propose to make any announcements \\nregarding changes to the tax laws. However, the current economic situation demands some \\ninterventions that cannot wait for the regular Budget. In particular, the manufacturing sector \\nneeds an immediate boost. Hence, I propose the following changes in some indirect tax rates: \\n(i) To stimulate growth in the capital goods and consumer non-durables, I propose \\nto reduce the excise duty from 12 percent to 10 percent on all goods falling \\nunder chapter 84 and chapter 85 of the Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff \\nAct for the period up to 30.6.2014. The rates can be reviewed at the time of the \\nregular Budget. \\n(ii) To give relief to the automobile industry which is registering unprecedented \\nnegative growth, I propose to reduce the excise duty as follows for the period \\nup to 30.6.2014: \\nSmall cars, motor cycles, scooters \\nand commercial vehicles } from 12% to 8% \\nSUVs } from 30% to 24% \\nLarge and mid-segment cars } from 27/24% to 24/20% \\n\\nConsequently, I propose to make appropriate reductions in the excise duty on \\nchassis and trailers. \\n\\nThe rates can be reviewed at the time of the regular Budget. \\n\\n(iii) To encourage domestic production of mobile handsets (which has declined) and \\nreduce the dependence on imports (which have increased), I propose to \\nrestructure the excise duties for all categories of mobile handsets. The rates will \\nbe 6 percent with CENVAT credit or 1 percent without CENVAT credit. \\n(iv) To encourage domestic production of soaps and oleo chemicals, \\nI propose to rationalise the customs duty structure on non-edible grade \\nindustrial oils and its fractions, fatty acids and fatty alcohols at 7.5 percent. \\n(v) To encourage domestic production of specified road construction machinery, I \\npropose to withdraw the exemption from CVD on similar imported machinery. \\n(vi) To encourage indigenous production of security paper for printing currency \\nnotes, I propose to provide a concessional customs duty of 5 percent on capital \\ngoods imported by the Bank Note Paper Mill India Private Limited. \\n77. I also propose to give relief from service tax in two cases. \\n(i) By virtue of the definition of ‘agricultural produce’ in Finance Act 2012, read \\nwith the Negative List, storage or warehousing of paddy was excluded from the \\nlevy of service tax. Rice was not. The distinction is somewhat artificial. Hence, \\nI propose to exempt loading, unloading, packing, storage and warehousing of \\nrice from service tax. \\n(ii) Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has requested that services provided by \\ncord blood banks are also healthcare services and should be exempt from \\nservice tax. I propose to accept the request. \\nNotifications in respect of the above changes will be issued today. \\n\\n\\x0c\\nBUDGET ESTIMATES \\n\\n78. I shall now present the Budget Estimates for 2014-15. \\n79. The current financial year will end on a satisfactory note with the fiscal deficit at 4.6 \\npercent (below the red line of 4.8 percent) and the revenue deficit at 3.3 percent. \\n80. Emboldened by the progress made, I have budgeted for receipts and expenditure in \\n2014-15 that will leave a fiscal deficit of 4.1 percent, which will be below the target set by \\nthe new fiscal consolidation path. Revenue deficit is estimated at 3.0 percent. \\n81. The estimate of plan expenditure is `555,322 crore. Non-plan expenditure is \\nestimated at `12,07,892 crore. \\nConclusion \\n\\n82. Madam Speaker, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen have pointed out that “India was the \\nfirst non-Western country – and also the first poor country in the world – to commit itself to a \\nresolutely democratic way of governance.” Democracy acknowledges diversity, respects \\ndissent, encourages debate, and decides through a government of elected representatives. \\nNeither populism nor majoritarianism nor individualism is an alternative way of governance. \\n83. Our way of governance has not come in the way of lifting 140 million people out of \\npoverty in the last ten years. That is the greatest achievement of the UPA Governments, and \\nwe are proud of the achievement. \\n84. In the ten years that I have been in the North Block, I have seen the best of times and \\ndifficult times. Never did I lose faith in Jawaharlal Nehru’s idea of India that, in the words of \\nSunil Khilnani, “sought to coordinate within the form of a modern state a variety of values: \\ndemocracy, religious tolerance, economic development and cultural pluralism.” It is with \\nthat faith that I shall remain on the bridge until the day when, I am sure, the people of India \\nwill entrust the responsibility to a hand that will hold the “sceptre swayed with equity.” Let \\nme sign off with the couplet from the sage, Thiruvalluvar: \\n“Vel Anru Venri Tharuvathu Mannavan \\nKol Athuvoom Kodaathu Enin.” \\n\\n(Not the spear but sceptre swayed with equity \\nAlone gives the ruler victory.) \\n\\n85. Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Interim Budget to the House.', 'Budget 2014-2015 \\n\\nSpeech of \\n\\nArun Jaitley \\n\\nMinister of Finance \\n\\nJuly 10, 2014 \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\nI rise to present the Budget for the year 2014-15. \\n\\nI. STATE OF THE ECONOMY \\n2. The people of India have decisively voted for a change. The verdict \\nrepresents the exasperation of the people with the status-quo. India unhesitatingly \\ndesires to grow. Those living below the poverty line are anxious to free themselves \\nfrom the curse of poverty. Those who have got an opportunity to emerge from \\nthe difficult challenges have become aspirational. They now want to be a part of \\nthe neo middle class. Their next generation has the hunger to use the opportunity \\nthat society provides for them. Slow decision making has resulted in a loss of \\nopportunity. Two years of sub five per cent growth in the Indian economy has \\nresulted in a challenging situation. We look forward to lower levels of inflation \\nas compared to the days of double digit rates of food inflation in the last two \\nyears. The country is in no mood to suffer unemployment, inadequate basic \\namenities, lack of infrastructure and apathetic governance. \\n3. The slowdown in India broadly reflects the trend in many economies. In \\ncontrast to the aftermath of the crisis of 2008-09 when restoration of growth in \\nadvanced economies was the primary concern, the continuing slowdown being \\npresently witnessed in many emerging economies has posed a threat to a sustained \\nglobal recovery. Fortunately, there are green shoots of recovery being seen in the \\nglobal economy. As per IMF, the world economy is projected to grow at 3.6 per \\ncent in 2014 vis-à-vis 3.0 per cent in 2013, with the Euro area expected to register \\na positive growth after the contraction witnessed in 2012 and 2013. However, \\nthe performance of the US economy with attendant implication for the \\nunconventional monetary policy stance and global financial conditions is pivotal \\nto the fate of global recovery in the coming years. These are the head winds \\n\\x0c\\n2 \\n\\nagainst which the Indian economy would have to maneuver its way to attain \\nhigh growth trajectory. \\n\\n4. As Finance Minister I am duty bound to usher in a policy regime that \\nwill result in the desired macro-economic outcome of higher growth, lower \\ninflation, sustained level of external sector balance and a prudent policy stance. \\nThe Budget is the most comprehensive action plan in this regard. In the first \\nBudget of this NDA government that I am presenting before the august House, \\nmy aim is to lay down a broad policy indicator of the direction in which we wish \\nto take this country. The steps that I will announce in this Budget are only the \\nbeginning of a journey towards a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent or above \\nwithin the next 3-4 years along with macro-economic stabilization that includes \\nlower levels of inflation, lesser fiscal deficit and a manageable current account \\ndeficit. Therefore, it would not be wise to expect everything that can be done or \\nmust be done to be in the first Budget presented within forty five days of the \\nformation of this Government. \\n5. While higher growth is a sine qua non, we cannot be oblivious of the fact \\nthat there is a large population of this country which is below the poverty line. It \\nis the poor who suffer the most. We have to ensure that our anti-poverty programs \\nare well targeted. The growing aspirations of the people will be reflected in the \\ndevelopment strategy followed by the Government led by the Prime Minister \\nShri Narendra Modi and its mandate of “Sab ka Saath Sab ka Vikas”. Allow me \\nto assure this House that we have taken up the challenge in the right earnest. We \\nshall leave no stone unturned in creating a vibrant and strong India. \\n6. The prevailing economic situation presents a great challenge. It calls for \\na conscious choice to be made by all of us. Should we allow this drift to carry on \\nand watch helplessly? Should we allow our future to suffer because of our \\nindecisiveness? Should we be victims of mere populism or wasteful expenditure? \\nTo me, the response and the remedy are both clear. The task before me today is \\nvery challenging because we need to revive growth, particularly in manufacturing \\nand infrastructure to raise adequate resources for our developmental needs. On \\nthe other hand, the task is simple if we accept the principle that we cannot spend \\nbeyond our means. We need to introduce fiscal prudence that will lead to fiscal \\nconsolidation and discipline. Fiscal prudence to me is of paramount importance \\nbecause of considerations of inter-generational equity. We cannot leave behind a \\nlegacy of debt for our future generations. We cannot go on spending today which \\nwould be financed by taxation at a future date. There is an urgent need to generate \\nmore resources to fuel the economy. For this, the tax to GDP ratio must be \\nimproved and non-tax revenues increased. We must remember that the decline \\nin fiscal deficit from 5.7 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 to 4.8 per cent in 2012-13 \\n\\x0c\\n3 \\n\\nand 4.5 per cent in 2013-14 was mainly achieved by reduction in expenditure \\nrather than by way of realization of higher revenue. Although, the external sector \\nwitnessed a turn-around with the year ending with a Current Account Deficit of \\n\\n1.7 per cent of the GDP against 4.7 per cent in 2012-13, this was mainly achieved \\nthrough restriction on non-essential imports and slowdown in overall aggregate \\ndemand. Going forward, we must continue to be watchful of the CAD. \\n7. My predecessor has set up a very difficult task of reducing fiscal deficit \\nto 4.1 per cent of the GDP in the current year. Considering that we had two years \\nof low GDP growth, an almost static industrial growth, a moderate increase in \\nindirect taxes, a large subsidy burden and not so encouraging tax buoyancy, the \\ntarget of 4.1 per cent fiscal deficit is indeed daunting. Difficult, as it may appear, \\nI have decided to accept this target as a challenge. One fails only when one stops \\ntrying. My Road map for fiscal consolidation is a fiscal deficit of 3.6 per cent for \\n2015-16 and 3 per cent for 2016-17. I am conscious of the fact that Iraq crisis is \\nleaving an impact on oil prices and the situation in the middle-east continues to \\nbe volatile. Monsoon this year appears more unpredictable. While inflation has \\nremained at elevated levels relative to what is perceived as acceptable, there has \\nbeen a gradual moderation in WPI recently, from a high of 7.35% in 2012-13 \\nand 5.98% in 2013-14. But we are still not out of the woods. We also must \\naddress fully the problem of black money which is curse of our economy. Faced \\nwith these adversities we have no option but to undertake some bold steps in \\norder to enhance economic activity and spur growth in the economy. These steps \\nare only the beginning of our effort to revive the growth spirit of the Indian \\nEconomy. They are directional. \\nExpenditure Management Commission \\n\\n8. My Government is committed to the principle of “Minimum Government \\nMaximum Governance”. To achieve this goal, time has come to review the \\nallocative and operational efficiencies of Government expenditure to achieve \\nmaximum output. The Government will constitute an Expenditure Management \\nCommission, which will look into various aspects of expenditure reforms to be \\nundertaken by the Government. The Commission will give its interim report \\nwithin this financial year. I also propose to overhaul the subsidy regime, including \\nfood and petroleum subsidies, and make it more targeted while providing full \\nprotection to the marginalized, poor and SC/STs. A new urea policy would also \\nbe formulated. \\nGST \\n\\n9. The debate whether to introduce a Goods and Services Tax (GST) must \\nnow come to an end. We have discussed the issue for the past many years. Some \\n\\x0c\\n4 \\n\\nStates have been apprehensive about surrendering their taxation jurisdiction; \\nothers want to be adequately compensated. I have discussed the matter with the \\nStates both individually and collectively. I do hope we are able to find a solution \\nin the course of this year and approve the legislative scheme which enables the \\nintroduction of GST. This will streamline the tax administration, avoid harassment \\nof the business and result in higher revenue collection both for the Centre and \\nthe States. I assure all States that government will be more than fair in dealing \\nwith them. \\n\\nTax Administration \\n\\n10. The sovereign right of the Government to undertake retrospective \\nlegislation is unquestionable. However, this power has to be exercised with \\nextreme caution and judiciousness keeping in mind the impact of each such \\nmeasure on the economy and the overall investment climate. This Government \\nwill not ordinarily bring about any change retrospectively which creates a fresh \\nliability. Hon’ble Members are aware that consequent upon certain retrospective \\namendments to the Income Tax Act 1961 undertaken through the Finance Act \\n2012, a few cases have come up in various courts and other legal fora. These \\ncases are at different stages of pendency and will naturally reach their logical \\nconclusion. At this juncture I would like to convey to this August House and also \\nthe investors community at large that we are committed to provide a stable and \\npredictable taxation regime that would be investor friendly and spur growth. \\nKeeping this in mind, we have decided that henceforth, all fresh cases arising \\nout of the retrospective amendments of 2012 in respect of indirect transfers and \\ncoming to the notice of the Assessing Officers will be scrutinized by a High \\nLevel Committee to be constituted by the CBDT before any action is initiated in \\nsuch cases. I hope the investor community both within India and abroad would \\nrepose confidence on our stated position and participate in the Indian growth \\nstory with renewed vigour. \\nAdvance Ruling and Other Tax Related Measures \\n\\n11. Tax demand of more than ` 4 lakh crore is under dispute and litigation \\nbefore various Courts and Appellate authorities. This is one of the serious concerns \\nof all taxpayers in this country. In order to reduce litigation in direct taxes, \\nI propose to make certain legislative and administrative changes. \\n12. Currently, an advance ruling can be obtained about the tax liability of a \\nnon-resident from the Authority for Advance Rulings. This facility is not available \\nto resident taxpayers except Public Sector Undertakings. I propose to enable \\nresident taxpayers to obtain an advance ruling in respect of their income tax \\nliability above a defined threshold. I also propose to strengthen the Authority for \\nAdvance Rulings by constituting additional benches. I further propose to enlarge \\n\\x0c\\n5 \\n\\nthe scope of the Income-tax Settlement Commission so that taxpayers may \\napproach the Commission for settlement of disputes. This would continue to be \\nonce in a lifetime opportunity for any taxpayer. \\n\\n13. As an administrative measure, I propose to set up a High Level Committee \\nto interact with trade and industry on a regular basis and ascertain areas where \\nclarity in tax laws is required. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, \\nthe Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Board of Excise and Customs \\nshall issue appropriate clarifications, wherever considered necessary, on the tax \\nissues within a period of two months. \\n14. Transfer Pricing is a major area of litigation for both resident and nonresident \\ntaxpayers. I have proposed certain changes in the Transfer Pricing \\nregulations, which I would spell out in Part-B of my speech. \\n15. I hope these measures would go a long way in improving the confidence \\nof taxpayers in the tax system and would provide certainty and clarity in tax \\nlaws. \\nFDI \\n\\n16. The policy of the NDA Government is to promote Foreign Direct \\nInvestment (FDI) selectively in sectors where it helps the larger interest of the \\nIndian Economy. FDI in several sectors is an additionality of resource which \\nhelps in promoting domestic manufacture and job creation. India today needs a \\nboost for job creation. Our manufacturing sector in particular needs a push for \\njob creation. \\n17. India today is the largest buyer of Defence equipment in the world. Our \\ndomestic manufacturing capacities are still at a nascent stage. We are buying \\nsubstantial part of our Defence requirements directly from foreign players. \\nCompanies controlled by foreign governments and foreign private sector are \\nsupplying our Defence requirements to us at a considerable outflow of foreign \\nexchange. Currently we permit 26 per cent FDI in Defence manufacturing. The \\ncomposite cap of foreign exchange is being raised to 49 per cent with full Indian \\nmanagement and control through the FIPB route. \\n18. The Insurance sector is investment starved. Several segments of the \\nInsurance sector need an expansion. The composite cap in the Insurance sector \\nis proposed to be increased up to 49 per cent from the current level of 26 per \\ncent, with full Indian management and control, through the FIPB route. \\n19. To encourage development of Smart Cities, which will also provide \\nhabitation for the neo-middle class, requirement of the built up area and capital \\nconditions for FDI is being reduced from 50,000 square metres to 20,000 square \\nmetres and from USD 10 million to USD 5 million respectively with a three year \\npost completion lock in. \\n\\x0c\\n6 \\n\\n20. To further encourage this, projects which commit at least 30 per cent of \\nthe total project cost for low cost affordable housing will be exempted from \\nminimum built up area and capitalisation requirements, with the condition of \\nthree year lock-in. \\n21. FDI in the manufacturing sector is today on the automatic route. The \\nmanufacturing units will be allowed to sell its products through retail including \\nE-commerce platforms without any additional approval. \\nBank Capitalization \\n\\n22. Financial stability is the foundation of a rapid recovery. Our banking \\nsystem needs to be further strengthened. To be in line with Basel-III norms there \\nis a requirement to infuse ` 2,40,000 crore as equity by 2018 in our banks. To \\nmeet this huge capital requirement we need to raise additional resources to fulfill \\nthis obligation. While preserving the public ownership, the capital of these banks \\nwill be raised by increasing the shareholding of the people in a phased manner \\nthrough the sale of shares largely through retail to common citizens of this country. \\nThus, while the government will continue to have majority shareholding, the \\ncitizens of India will also get direct shareholding in these banks, which currently \\nthey hold indirectly. We will also examine the proposal to give greater autonomy \\nto the banks while making them accountable. \\nPSU Capital Expenditure \\n\\n23. To give a thrust to investment in the economy, PSUs will also play their \\npart constructively. I am assured that the PSUs will invest through capital \\ninvestment a total sum of ` 2,47,941 crores in the current financial year to create \\na virtuous investment cycle. \\nSmart Cities \\n\\n24. As the fruits of development reach an increasingly large number of people, \\nthe pace of migration from the rural areas to the cities is increasing. A neo middle \\nclass is emerging which has the aspiration of better living standards. Unless, \\nnew cities are developed to accommodate the burgeoning number of people, the \\nexisting cities would soon become unlivable. The Prime Minister has a vision of \\ndeveloping ‘one hundred Smart Cities’, as satellite towns of larger cities and by \\nmodernizing the existing mid-sized cities. To provide the necessary focus to this \\ncritical activity, I have provided a sum of `7,060 crore in the current fiscal. \\ne-Visa \\n\\n25. Tourism is one of the larger job creators globally. Many economies world \\nover are supported by tourism. In order to give a major boost to tourism in India, \\nthe facility of Electronic Travel Authorization (e-Visa) would be introduced in a \\n\\x0c\\n7 \\n\\nphased manner at nine airports in India where necessary infrastructure would be \\nput in place within the next six months. The countries to which the Electronic \\nTravel authorisation facility would be extended would be identified in a phased \\nmanner. This would further facilitate the visa on arrival facility. \\n\\nREITs & InvITs \\n\\n26. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) have been successfully used as \\ninstruments for pooling of investment in several countries. I intend to provide \\nnecessary incentives for REITS which will have pass through for the purpose of \\ntaxation. As an innovation, a modified REITS type structure for infrastructure \\nprojects is also being announced as Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), \\nwhich would have a similar tax efficient pass through status, for PPP and other \\ninfrastructure projects. These structures would reduce the pressure on the banking \\nsystem while also making available fresh equity. I am confident these two \\ninstruments would attract long term finance from foreign and domestic sources \\nincluding the NRIs. \\nKissan Vikas Patra \\n\\n27. Kissan Vikas Patra (KVP) was a very popular instrument among small \\nsavers. I plan to reintroduce the instrument to encourage people, who may have \\nbanked and unbanked savings to invest in this instrument. \\nSkill India \\n\\n28. A national multi-skill programme called Skill India is proposed to be \\nlaunched. It would skill the youth with an emphasis on employability and \\nentrepreneur skills. It will also provide training and support for traditional \\nprofessions like welders, carpenters, cobblers, masons, blacksmiths, weavers \\netc. Convergence of various schemes to attain this objective is also proposed. \\nPradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana \\n\\n29. Bulk of our farm lands are rain fed and dependent on monsoons. Therefore, \\nthere is a need to provide assured irrigation to mitigate risk. To improve access \\nto irrigation we propose to initiate the scheme “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee \\nYojana”. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 1,000 crore for this purpose. \\nSwatchh Bharat Abhiyan \\n\\n30. The need for sanitation is of utmost importance. Although the Central \\nGovernment is providing resources within its means, the task of total sanitation \\ncannot be achieved without the support of all. The Government intends to cover \\nevery household by total sanitation by the year 2019, the 150th year of the Birth \\nanniversary of Mahatma Gandhi through Swatchh Bharat Abhiyan. \\n\\x0c\\n8 \\n\\nShyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission \\n\\n31. Gujarat has demonstrated successfully the Rurban development model \\nof urbanization of the rural areas, through which people living in the rural areas \\ncan get efficient civic infrastructure and associate services. Shyama Prasad \\nMukherji Rurban Mission will be launched to deliver integrated project based \\ninfrastructure in the rural areas, which will also include development of economic \\nactivities and skill development. The preferred mode of delivery would be through \\nPPPs while using various scheme funds for financing. \\nDeendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana \\n\\n32. Power is a vital input for economic growth and the Government is \\ncommitted to providing 24x7 uninterrupted power supply to all homes. “Deen \\nDayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana” for feeder separation will be launched to \\naugment power supply to the rural areas and for strengthening sub-transmission \\nand distribution systems. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 500 crore for this \\npurpose. \\nStatue of Unity \\n\\n33. Government of Gujarat has embarked upon the mission to build the largest \\nstatue of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel. Sardar Patel stands as the symbol of the \\nunity of the country. To support the Gujarat Government in this initiative to erect \\nthe Statue of Unity, I propose to set aside a sum of ` 200 crore. \\nII. PLAN & BUDEGTARY ALLOCATIONS \\n34. I now turn to budgetary allocations. While announcing the allocations, \\nI want to reiterate my Government’s firm commitment to strengthen the federal \\nstructure of the country and our resolve to work closely with the state governments \\nfor the larger good of the people. \\nWelfare of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes \\n\\n35. Government is committed to the welfare of SCs and STs. This year an \\namount of ` 50,548 crore is proposed under the SC Plan and ` 32,387 crore \\nunder TSP. \\n36. To provide credit enhancement facility for young start up enterpreneurs \\nfrom Scheduled Castes, who aspire to be part of the neo-middle class, I propose \\nto set aside a sum of ` 200 crore which will be operationalised through a scheme \\nby IFCI. \\n37. For the welfare of the tribals “Van Bandhu Kalyan Yojana” is being \\nlaunched with an initial allocation of ` 100 crore. \\n\\x0c\\n9 \\n\\nWelfare of Senior Citizens \\n\\nVarishtha Pension Bima Yojana \\n\\n38. NDA Government during its last term in office had introduced the \\nVarishtha Pension Bima Yojana (VPBY) as a pension scheme for senior citizens. \\nUnder the scheme a total no. of 3.16 lakh annuitants are being benefitted and the \\ncorpus amounts to ` 6,095 crore. I propose to revive the scheme for a limited \\nperiod from 15 August, 2014 to 14 August, 2015 for the benefit of citizens aged \\n60 years and above. \\n39. A large amount of money is estimated to be lying as unclaimed amounts \\nwith PPF, Post Office, saving schemes etc. These are mostly out of investments \\nbelonging to the senior citizens and on their demise, remain unclaimed for want \\nof relevant payment instructions. I propose to set up a committee to examine and \\nrecommend how this amount can be used to protect and further financial interests \\nof the senior citizens. The committee will give its report not later than December \\nthis year. \\n40. Government is fully committed to the social security and welfare of \\nemployees serving in the organized sector. The Government is notifying minimum \\npension of ` 1,000 per month to all subscriber members of EP Scheme and has \\nmade an initial provision of ` 250 crore in the current financial year to meet the \\nexpenditure. Further, increase in mandatory wage ceiling of subscription to EPS \\nfrom ` 6,500 to ` 15,000 has been made and a provision of ` 250 crore has been \\nprovided in the current budget. For the convenience of the subscribers, EPFO \\nwill launch the “Uniform Account Number” Service for contributing members \\nto facilitate portability of Provident Fund accounts. \\nEmpowerment of the Differently Abled Persons \\n\\n41. Government will make all out efforts to create a more inclusive society \\nfor Persons with Disabilities to enable them to enjoy equal opportunities to lead \\nan empowered life with dignity. I propose to extend the scheme for Assistance to \\nDisabled Persons for purchase/fitting of Aids and Appliances (ADIP) to include \\ncontemporary aids and assistive devices. It is also proposed to establish National \\nlevel institutes for Universal Inclusive Design and Mental Health Rehabilitation \\nand also a Centre for Disability Sports. \\nIncentives for the Visually Challenged \\n\\n42. The Braille Presses in the Government and private sector are not able to \\nmeet the demand of Braille Text books for the visually impaired students. It is \\nproposed to provide assistance to the State Governments to establish fifteen new \\nBraille Presses and modernize ten existing Braille Presses in the current financial \\nyear. Government will also print currency notes with Braille like signs to assist \\nthe visibly challenged persons. \\n\\x0c\\n10 \\n\\nWomen & Child Development \\n\\n43. Women’s safety is a concern shared by all the honourable members of \\nthis House. We need to test out different approaches that can be validated and \\nscaled up quickly. An outlay of ` 50 crores will be spent by Ministry of Road \\nTransport & Highways on pilot testing a scheme on “Safety for Women on Public \\nRoad Transport”. A sum of ` 150 crores will also be spent by Ministry of Home \\nAffairs on a scheme to increase the safety of women in large cities. It is also \\nproposed to set up “Crisis Management Centres” in all the districts of NCT of \\nDelhi this year in all government and private hospitals. The funding will be \\nprovided from the Nirbhaya Fund. \\nBeti Bachao, Beti Padhao Yojana \\n\\n44. It is a shame that while the country has emerged as a major player amongst \\nthe emerging market economies, the apathy towards girl child is still quite rampant \\nin many parts of the country. Therefore I propose to launch Beti Bachao, Beti \\nPadhao Yojana which will be a focused scheme which would help in generating \\nawareness and also help in improving the efficiency of delivery of welfare services \\nmeant for women. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for this. \\nGender Mainstreaming \\n\\n45. Government would focus on campaigns to sensitize people of this country \\ntowards the concerns of the girl child and women. The process of sensitization \\nmust begin early, therefore, the school curriculum must have a separate chapter \\non gender mainstreaming. \\nRural Development \\n\\nPradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana \\n\\n46. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana initiated during the NDA-I under \\nthe stewardship of Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has had a massive impact \\nin improvement of access for Rural population. It is time to reaffirm our \\ncommitment to a better and more energetic PMGSY under the dynamic leadership \\nof Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. I propose to provide a sum of ` 14,389 \\ncrore. \\nMGNREGA \\n\\n47. The Government is committed to providing wage and self-employment \\nopportunities in rural areas. However, wage employment would be provided \\nunder MGNREGA through works that are more productive, asset creating and \\nsubstantially linked to agriculture and allied activities. \\n\\x0c\\n11 \\n\\nNational Livelihood Mission \\n\\n48. Ajeevika, the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), aims to \\neliminate rural poverty through sustainable livelihood options. Under this mission, \\nWomen SHGs are provided bank loans at 4% on prompt repayment in 150 districts \\nand at 7% in all other districts. I propose to extend the provision of bank loan for \\nwomen SHGs at 4% in another 100 districts. I also propose to set up a “Start Up \\nVillage Entrepreneurship Programme” for encouraging rural youth to take up \\nlocal entrepreneurship programs. I am providing an initial sum of ` 100 crore \\nfor this. \\nRural Housing \\n\\n49. The Rural Housing Scheme has benefited a large percentage of rural \\npopulation who have availed credit through Rural Housing Fund (RHF). \\nAccordingly, I propose to increase the allocations for the year 2014-15 to ` 8,000 \\ncrore for National Housing Bank (NHB) with a view to expand and continue to \\nsupport Rural Housing in the country. \\nWatershed Development \\n\\n50. To give an added impetus to watershed development in the country, \\nI propose to start a new programme called “Neeranchal” with an initial outlay of \\n` 2,142 crores in the current financial year. \\nPanchayati Raj \\n\\n51. Backward Region Grant Fund (BRGF) is being implemented in 272 \\nbackward districts in 27 States, to fill up the critical gaps in development of \\nbasic infrastructure facilities and for capacity building of Panchayats/ Gram \\nSabhas in backward areas. It is proposed to restructure the BRGF to address \\nintra-district inequalities to ensure that backward sub-districts units within States \\nreceive adequate support. \\nSafe Drinking Water \\n\\n52. Many of our drinking water sources have excess impurities like flouride, \\narsenic and manmade contaminations due to untreated sewage, industrial effluents \\nand leaching of pesticides and fertilizers. It is proposed to earmark ` 3,600 crore \\nunder National Rural Drinking Water Programme for providing safe drinking \\nwater in approximately 20,000 habitations affected with arsenic, fluoride, heavy/ \\ntoxic elements, pesticides/ fertilizers through community water purification plants \\nin next 3 years. \\n\\x0c\\n12 \\n\\nHealth and Family Welfare \\n\\n53. To move towards “Health for All”, the two key initiatives i.e. the Free \\nDrug Service and Free Diagnosis Service would be taken up on priority. \\n54. In order to achieve universal access to early quality diagnosis and \\ntreatment to TB patients, two National Institutes of Ageing will be set up at \\nAIIMS, New Delhi and Madras Medical College, Chennai. A national level \\nresearch and referral Institute for higher dental studies would be set up in one of \\nthe existing Dental institutions. \\n55. It is a matter of great satisfaction that all the six new AIIMS at Jodhpur, \\nBhopal, Patna, Rishikesh, Bhubaneswar and Raipur, which are part of Pradhan \\nMantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, have become functional. A plan to set up \\nfour more AIIMS like institutions at Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Vidarbha in \\nMaharashtra and Poorvanchal in UP is under consideration. I propose to set \\naside a sum of ` 500 crore for this. Presently 58 government medical colleges \\nhave been approved. It is also proposed to add 12 more government medical \\ncolleges. In addition, dental facilities would also be provided in all the hospitals. \\n56. For the first time, the Central Government will provide central assistance \\nto strengthen the States’ Drug Regulatory and Food Regulatory Systems by \\ncreating new drug testing laboratories and strengthening the 31 existing State \\nlaboratories. \\n57. In keeping with the Government’s focus on improving affordable \\nhealthcare and to augment the transfer of technology for better health care facilities \\nin rural India, fifteen Model Rural Health Research shall be set up in the states, \\nwhich shall take up research on local health issues concerning rural population. \\nEducation \\n\\nSchool Education \\n\\n58. Elementary education is one of the major priorities of the Government. \\nThere is a residual gap in providing minimal school infrastructure facilities. \\nGovernment would strive to provide toilets and drinking water in all the girls \\nschool in first phase. An amount of ` 28,635 crore is being funded for Sarva \\nShiksha Abhiyan and `4,966 crore for Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan. \\nA School Assessment Programme is being initiated at a cost of ` 30 crore. To \\ninfuse new training tools and motivate teachers, “Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya \\nNew Teachers Training Programme” is being launched. I am setting aside an \\ninitial sum of ` 500 crore for this. \\n59. To take advantage of the reach of the IT, I propose to allocate a sum of \\n`100 crore for setting up virtual classrooms as Communication Linked Interface \\nfor Cultivating Knowledge (CLICK) and online courses. \\n\\x0c\\n13 \\n\\nHigher Education \\n\\n60. The country needs a large number of Centres of higher learning which \\nare world class. I propose to set up Jai Prakash Narayan National Centre for \\nExcellence in Humanities in Madhya Pradesh. I also intend to set up five more \\nIITs in the Jammu, Chattisgarh, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. Five IIMs \\nwould be set up in the States of Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Odisha and \\nMaharashtra. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 500 crore for this. \\n61. Government also proposes to ease and simplify norms to facilitate \\neducation loans for higher studies. \\nDigital India \\n\\n62. There is an imminent need to further bridge the divide between digital \\n“haves” and “have-nots”. For this it is proposed to launch a pan India programme \\n“Digital India”. This would ensure Broad band connectivity at village level, \\nimproved access to services through IT enabled platforms, greater transparency \\nin Government processes and increased indigenous production of IT hardware \\nand software for exports and improved domestic availability. Special focus would \\nbe on supporting software product startups. A National Rural Internet and \\nTechnology Mission for services in villages and schools, training in IT skills and \\nE-Kranti for government service delivery and governance scheme is also \\nproposed. I have provided a sum of ` 500 crore for this purpose. \\n63. A programme for promoting “Good Governance” would be launched \\nand I propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for this. \\nInformation and Broadcasting \\n\\n64. So far around 400 permissions for setting up of a Community Radio \\nStations have been issued. To encourage the growth in this sector, a new plan \\nscheme is being taken up with an allocation of ` 100 crore. This scheme would \\nsupport about 600 new and existing Community Radio Stations. \\n65. Film & Television Institute, Pune and Satyajit Ray Film & Television \\nInstitute, Kolkata are proposed to be accorded status of Institutes of national \\nimportance and a “National Centre for Excellence in Animation, Gaming and \\nSpecial Effects will be set up. \\nUrban Development \\n\\nUrban Renewal \\n\\n66. It is time that our cities and towns undergo urban renewal and become \\nbetter places to live in. While developing housing and other infrastructure, both \\nphysical and economic, which can have local variations, four fundamental \\n\\x0c\\n14 \\n\\nactivities must underpin such development. These are provision of safe drinking \\nwater and sewerage management, use of recycled water for growing organic \\nfruits and vegetable, solid waste management and digital connectivity. It is the \\nvision of this Government that at least five hundred (500) such habitations must \\nbe provided support, while harnessing private capital and expertise through PPPs, \\nto renew their infrastructure and services in the next ten years. \\n\\nPooled Municipal Debt Obligation Facility \\n\\n67. Pooled Municipal Debt Obligation Facility: This facility was set up in \\n2006 with participation of several Banks to promote and finance infrastructure \\nprojects in Urban Area on shared risk basis. Present corpus of this facility is \\n`5,000 Crores. This Government has a major focus of providing good \\ninfrastructure, including public transport, solid waste disposal, sewerage treatment \\nand drinking water in the urban areas. In keeping with the Hon’ble Prime \\nMinister’s vision for urban areas it is proposed to enlarge it to ` 50,000 Crores \\nwith extension of the facility by five years to March 31, 2019. \\nUrban Transportation \\n\\n68. Urban Metro Projects have proven to be very useful in decongesting \\nlarge cities. For two million plus cities, planning of metro projects must begin \\nnow. Government will encourage development of metro rail systems, including \\nlight rail systems, in the PPP mode, which will be supported by the Central \\nGovernment through VGF. In the current financial year, I propose to set aside a \\nsum of ` 100 crore for Metro Projects in Lucknow and Ahemdabad. \\nHousing for All \\n\\n69. Our government is committed to endeavour to have housing for all by \\n2022. For this purpose, I intend to extend additional tax incentive on home loans \\nto encourage people, especially the young, to own houses. \\n70. I propose setting up a Mission on Low Cost Affordable Housing which \\nwill be anchored in the National Housing Bank. Schemes will be evolved to \\nincentivize the development of low cost affordable housing. I propose to allocate \\nthis year also a sum of ` 4,000 crores for NHB with a view to increase the flow \\nof cheaper credit for affordable housing to the urban poor/EWS/LIG segment. \\nI have already outlined some other incentives such as easier flow of FDI in this \\nsector. Government is willing to examine other suggestions that would spur \\ngrowth in this sector. \\n71. I also propose to add inclusion of slum development in the list of Corporate \\nSocial Responsibility (CSR) activities to encourage the private sector to contribute \\nmore towards this activity. \\n\\x0c\\n15 \\n\\nMalnutrition \\n\\n72. A national programme in Mission Mode is urgently required to halt the \\ndeteriorating malnutrition situation in India, as present interventions are not \\nadequate. A comprehensive strategy including detailed methodology, costing, \\ntime lines and monitorable targets will be put in place within six months. \\nMinorities \\n\\n73. A programme for the up gradation of skills and training in ancestral arts \\nfor development for the minorities called “Up gradation of Traditional Skills in \\nArts, Resources and Goods” would be launched to preserve the traditional arts \\nand crafts which are rich heritage. \\n74. An additional amount of ` 100 crores for Modernization of Madarsas \\nhas been provided to the Department of School Education. \\nIII. AGRICULTURE \\n75. Farming as an activity contributes nearly 1/6th to our National GDP and \\na major portion of our population is dependent on it for livelihood. It has risen to \\nthe challenge of making India largely self-sufficient in providing food for a \\ngrowing population. To make farming competitive and profitable, there is an \\nurgent need to step up investment, both public and private, in agro-technology \\ndevelopment and creation and modernization of existing agri-business \\ninfrastructure. Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa has been at the \\nforefront of research in this area. However, since independence only one such \\ncentre has been established. Government will establish two more such institutions \\nof excellence on similar pattern in Assam and Jharkhand with an initial sum of \\n`100 crore in the current financial year. In addition, an amount of ` 100 crores is \\nbeing set aside for setting up an “Agri-Tech Infrastructure Fund”. \\n76. It is also proposed to establish Agriculture Universities in Andhra Pradesh \\nand Rajasthan and Horticulture Universities in Telangana and Haryana. An initial \\nsum of ` 200 crores has been allocated for this purpose. \\n77. Deteriorating soil health has been a cause of concern and leads to sub \\noptimal utilization of farming resources. Government will initiate a scheme to \\nprovide to every farmer a soil health card in a Mission mode. I propose to set \\naside a sum of ` 100 crore for this purpose and an additional ` 56 crores to set up \\n100 Mobile Soil Testing Laboratories across the country. There have also been \\ngrowing concerns about the imbalance in the utilization of different types of \\nfertilizers resulting in deterioration of the soil. \\n78. Climate change is a reality which all of us have to face together. \\nAgriculture as an activity is most prone to the vagaries of climate change. To \\n\\x0c\\n16 \\n\\nmeet this challenge, I propose to establish a “National Adaptation Fund” for \\nclimate change. As an initial sum an amount of ` 100 crore will be transferred to \\nthe Fund. \\n\\n79. We are committed to sustaining a growth of 4% in Agriculture and for \\nthis we will bring technology driven second green revolution with focus on higher \\nproductivity and include “Protein revolution” as an area of major focus. \\n80. As a very large number of landless farmers are unable to provide land \\ntitle as guarantee, institutional finance is denied to them and they become \\nvulnerable to money lenders’ usurious lending. I propose to provide finance to 5 \\nlakh joint farming groups of “Bhoomi Heen Kisan” through NABARD in the \\ncurrent financial year. \\n81. Price volatility in the agriculture produce creates uncertainties and \\nhardship for the farmers. To mitigate this I am providing a sum of ` 500 crore for \\nestablishing a Price Stabilization Fund. \\n82. The farmers and consumers’ interest will be further served by increasing \\ncompetition and integrating markets across the country. To accelerate setting up \\nof a National Market, the Central Government will work closely with the State \\nGovernments to re-orient their respective APMC Acts., to provide for \\nestablishment of private market yards/ private markets. The state governments \\nwill also be encouraged to develop Farmers’ Markets in town areas to enable the \\nfarmers to sell their produce directly. \\n83. I also propose to set aside a sum of ` 50 crores for the development of \\nindigenous cattle breeds and an equal amount for starting a blue revolution in \\ninland fisheries. \\nAgriculture Credit \\n\\n84. Banks are providing strong credit support to the agriculture sector. A \\ntarget of ` 8 lakh crore has been set for agriculture credit during 2014-15 which, \\nI am confident, the banks will surpass this. \\nInterest Subvention Scheme for Short Term Crop Loans \\n\\n85. Under the Interest Subvention Scheme for short term crop loans, the \\nbanks are extending loans to farmers at a concessional rate of 7%. The farmers \\nget a further incentive of 3% for timely repayment. I propose to continue the \\nScheme in 2014-15. \\nRural Infrastructure Development Fund \\n\\n86. NABARD operates the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF), \\nout of the priority sector lending shortfall of the banks, which helps in creation \\n\\x0c\\n17 \\n\\nof infrastructure in agriculture and rural sectors across the country. I propose to \\nraise the corpus of RIDF by an additional ` 5,000 crores from the target given in \\nthe Interim Budget to ` 25,000 crores in the current financial year. \\n\\nWarehouse Infrastructure Fund \\n\\n87. Increasing warehousing capacity for increasing the shelf life of agriculture \\nproduces and thereby the earning capacity of the farmers is of utmost importance. \\nKeeping in view the urgent need for availability of scientific warehousing \\ninfrastructure in the country, I propose an allocation of ` 5,000 crore for the fund \\nfor the year 2014-15. \\nCreation of Long Term Rural Credit Fund \\n\\n88. The share of long term investment credit in agriculture is going down as \\ncompared to short term crop loan. This is severely hampering the asset creation \\nin agriculture and allied activities. In order to give a boost to long term investment \\ncredit in agriculture, I propose to set up “Long Term Rural Credit Fund” in \\nNABARD for the purpose of providing refinance support to Cooperative Banks \\nand Regional Rural Banks with an initial corpus of ` 5,000 crore. \\nAllocation of STCRC (Refinance) Fund \\n\\n89. The Short Term Cooperative Rural Credit (STCRC) – Refinance Fund \\nwas announced in Union Budget 2008-09 with initial corpus of ` 5,000 crore. In \\norder to ensure increased and uninterrupted credit flow to farmers and to avoid \\nhigh cost market borrowings by NABARD, I propose to allocate an amount of \\n`50,000 crore for STCRC Fund during 2014-15. \\nProducers Development and Upliftment Corpus (PRODUCE) \\n\\n90. The issue of profitability of small holding based agriculture has assumed \\nimportance in view of increasing proportion of small and marginal farmers in \\nthe country. I propose to supplement NABARD’s Producers’ organization \\ndevelopment fund for Producer’s development and upliftment called PRODUCE \\nwith a sum of ` 200 crore which will be utilized for building 2,000 producers \\norganizations across the country over the next two years. \\nFood Security \\n\\n91. Government is committed to reforms in the food sector. Restructuring \\nFCI, reducing transportation and distribution losses and efficacy of PDS would \\nbe taken up on priority. \\n92. Government is also committed to provide wheat and rice at reasonable \\nprices to the weaker sections of the society. Even if due to inadequate rainfall \\n\\x0c\\n18 \\n\\nthere is a marginal decline in agriculture production, stocks in the Central pool \\nare adequate to meet any exigency. Government shall, when required, undertake \\nopen market sales to keep prices under control. \\n\\nKisan TV \\n\\n93. Kisan TV, dedicated to the interests of the agriculture and allied sector \\nwill be launched in the current financial year. This will disseminate real time \\ninformation to the farmers information regarding new farming techniques, water \\nconservation, organic farming etc. I propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for \\nthis purpose. \\nIV. INDUSTRY \\n94. The eBiz platform aims to create a business and investor friendly \\necosystem in India by making all business and investment related clearances \\nand compliances available on a 24x7 single portal, with an integrated payment \\ngateway. All Central Government Departments and Ministries will integrate their \\nservices with the eBiz platform on priority by 31 December this year. \\n95. A National Industrial Corridor Authority, with its headquarters in Pune, \\nis being set up to coordinate the development of the industrial corridors, with \\nsmart cities linked to transport connectivity, which will be the cornerstone of the \\nstrategy to drive India’s growth in manufacturing and urbanization. I have \\nprovided an initial corpus of ` 100 crore for this purpose. \\n96. The Amritsar Kolkata Industrial master planning will be completed \\nexpeditiously for the establishment of industrial smart cities in seven States of \\nIndia. The master planning of three new smart cities in the Chennai-Bengaluru \\nIndustrial Corridor region, viz., Ponneri in Tamil Nadu, Krishnapatnam in Andhra \\nPradesh and Tumkur in Karnataka will also be completed. \\n97. The perspective plan for the Bengaluru Mumbai Economic corridor \\n(BMEC) and Vizag-Chennai corridor would be completed with the provision \\nfor 20 new industrial clusters. \\n98. Kakinada, its adjoining area and the port will be developed as the key \\ndrivers of economic growth in the region with a special focus on hardware \\nmanufacturing. \\n99. Exports cannot be exponentially increased unless the states play a very \\nactive role in export promotion by providing good infrastructure and full \\nfacilitation. It will be our endeavor to engage with the states to take India’s exports \\nto a higher growth trajectory. It is proposed to establish an Export promotion \\nMission to bring all stakeholders under one umbrella. \\n\\x0c\\n19 \\n\\nSpecial Economic Zones \\n\\n100. The Government is committed to revive the Special Economic Zones \\n(SEZs) and make them effective instruments of industrial production, economic \\ngrowth, export promotion and employment generation. For achieving this, \\neffective steps would be undertaken to operationalize the Special Economic \\nZones, to revive the investors’ interest to develop better infrastructure and to \\neffectively and efficiently use the available unutilized land. \\nApprenticeship \\n\\n101. Comparing the size of the Indian economy, the performance of the \\nApprenticeship Training Scheme is not satisfactory and a large number of training \\nfacilities in the industry are unutilized. Apprenticeship Act will be suitably \\namended to make it more responsive to industry and youth. We will also encourage \\nMSMEs to avail of the benefits of this scheme. \\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector \\n\\n102. SMEs form the backbone of our Economy. They account for a large \\nportion of our industrial output and employment. The bulk of service sector \\nenterprises are also SMEs. Most of these SMEs are Own Account Enterprises. \\nMost importantly a majority of these enterprises are owned or run by SCs, STs \\nand OBCs. Financing to this sector is of critical importance, particularly as it \\nbenefits the weakest sections. There is need to examine the financial architecture \\nfor this sector. I propose to appoint a committee with representatives from the \\nFinance Ministry, Ministry of MSME, RBI to give concrete suggestions in three \\nmonths. \\n103. Promotion of entrepreneurship and start-up Companies remains a \\nchallenge. While there have been some efforts to encourage, one principal \\nlimitation has been availability of start-up capital by way of equity to be brought \\nin by the promoters. In order to create a conducive eco-system for the venture \\ncapital in the MSME sector it is proposed to establish a ` 10,000 crore fund to \\nact as a catalyst to attract private Capital by way of providing equity, quasi equity, \\nsoft loans and other risk capital for start-up companies. \\n104. To establish technology centre network to promote innovation, \\nentrepreneurship and agro-industry, I propose to set up a fund with a corpus of \\n`200 crore. \\n105. The definition of MSME will be reviewed to provide for a higher capital \\nceiling. A programme to facilitate forward and backward linkages with multiple \\nvalue chain of manufacturing and service delivery will also be put in place. \\n\\x0c\\n20 \\n\\n106. Entrepreneur friendly legal bankruptcy framework will also be developed \\nfor SMEs to enable easy exit. A nationwide “District level Incubation and \\nAccelerator Programme” would be taken up for incubation of new ideas and \\nproviding necessary support for accelerating entrepreneurship. \\nTextiles \\n\\n107. I propose to set up a Trade Facilitation Centre and a Crafts Museum with \\nan outlay of ` 50 crore to develop and promote handloom products and carry \\nforward the rich tradition of handlooms of Varanasi, where I also intend to support \\na Textile mega-cluster. I also propose to set up six more Textile mega-clusters at \\nBareily, Lucknow, Surat, Kuttch, Bhagalpur, Mysore and one in Tamil Nadu. \\nI am allocating a sum of ` 200 crore for this purpose. \\n108. I also propose to set up a Hastkala Academy for the preservation, revival, \\nand documentation of the handloom/handicraft sector in PPP mode in Delhi. \\nI have set aside a sum of ` 30 crore for this purpose. \\n109. I propose to start a Pashmina Promotion Programme (P-3) and a \\nprogramme for the development of other crafts of Jammu & Kashmir. I am setting \\naside a sum of `50 crore for this purpose. \\nV. INFRASTRUCTURE \\n110. India has emerged as the largest PPP market in the world with over 900 \\nprojects in various stages of development. PPPs have delivered some of the \\niconic infrastructure like airports, ports and highways which are seen as models \\nfor development globally. But we have also seen the weaknesses of the PPP \\nframework, the rigidities in contractual arrangements, the need to develop more \\nnuanced and sophisticated models of contracting and develop quick dispute \\nredressal mechanism. An institution to provide support to mainstreaming PPPs \\ncalled 3P India will be set up with a corpus of `500 crores. \\nShipping \\n\\n111. A policy for encouraging the growth of Indian controlled tonnage will be \\nformulated to ensure increase in employment of the Indian seafarers. Development \\nof ports is also critical for boosting trade. Sixteen new port projects are proposed \\nto be awarded this year with a focus on port connectivity. ` 11,635 crore will be \\nallocated for the development of Outer Harbour Project in Tuticorin for phase I. \\nSEZs will also be developed in Kandla and JNPT. A comprehensive policy will \\nalso be announced to promote Indian ship building industry in the current financial \\nyear. \\n\\x0c\\n21 \\n\\nInland Navigation \\n\\n112. Development of inland waterways can improve vastly the capacity for \\nthe transportation of goods. A project on the river Ganga called ‘Jal Marg Vikas’ \\n(National Waterways-I) will be developed between Allahabad and Haldia to cover \\na distance of 1620 kms, which will enable commercial navigation of at least \\n1500 tonne vessels. The project will be completed over a period of six years at \\nan estimated cost of ` 4,200 crore. \\nNew Airports \\n\\n113. Despite increase in air connectivity air travel is still out of reach of a \\nlarge number of aspirational Indians. Scheme for development of new airports \\nin Tier I and Tier II will be launched for implementation through Airport Authority \\nof India or PPPs. \\nRoads sector \\n\\n114. Roads sector constitutes a very import artery of communication in the \\ncountry. The sector had taken shape from 1998-2004 under NDA-I. The sector \\nagain needs huge amount of investment along with debottlenecking from maze \\nof clearances. I propose investment in National Highways Authority of India \\nand State Roads of an amount of `37,880 crores, which includes ` 3,000 crores \\nfor the North East. During CFY a target of NH construction of 8500 km will be \\nachieved. \\n115. A modern nation needs multiple sources of transport. A country of the \\nsize of India must have a transport network which can ensure faster travel across \\ncities which are geographically distant. This will also improve the supply chain \\nin transporting goods across cities. We will initiate work on select expressways \\nin parallel to the development of the Industrial Corridors. For project preparation \\nNHAI shall set aside a sum of ` 500 crore. \\nPower \\n\\n116. To promote cleaner and more efficient thermal power, I propose to allocate \\nan initial sum of ` 100 crore for preparatory work for a new scheme “Ultra-\\nModern Super Critical Coal Based Thermal Power Technology.” \\nCoal \\n\\n117. Comprehensive measures for enhancing domestic coal production are \\nbeing put in place along with stringent mechanism for quality control and \\nenvironmental protection, which includes supply of crushed coal and setting up \\nof washeries. The existing impasse in the coal sector will be resolved and adequate \\nquantity of coal will be provided to power plants which are already commissioned \\nor would be commissioned by March 2015, to unlock dead investments. An \\n\\x0c\\n22 \\n\\nexercise to rationalize coal linkages which will optimize transport of coal and \\nreduce cost of power is underway. \\n\\nNew & Renewable Energy \\n\\n118. New and Renewable energy deserves a very high priority. It is proposed \\nto take up Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, \\nand Laddakh in J&K. I have set aside a sum of ` 500 crores for this. We are \\nlaunching a scheme for solar power driven agricultural pump sets and water \\npumping stations for energizing one lakh pumps. I propose to allocate a sum of \\n` 400 crores for this purpose. An additional ` 100 crore is set aside for the \\ndevelopment of 1 MW Solar Parks on the banks of canals. Implementation of \\nthe Green Energy Corridor Project will be accelerated in this financial year to \\nfacilitate evacuation of renewable energy across the country. \\nPetroleum & Natural Gas \\n\\n119. It is my Government’s intention to accelerate production and exploitation \\nof Coal Bed Methane reserves. The possibility of using modern technology to \\nrevive old or closed wells will also be explored to maximize production from \\nsuch fields. \\n120. The usage of PNG will be rapidly scaled up in a Mission mode as it is \\n“clean” and efficient to deliver. \\n121. We have at present about 15,000 km of gas pipeline systems in the country. \\nIn order to complete the gas grid across the country, an additional 15,000 km of \\npipelines are required. It is proposed to develop these pipelines using appropriate \\nPPP models. This will help increase the usage of gas, domestic as well as imported, \\nwhich, in the long-term will be beneficial in reducing dependence on any one \\nenergy sources. \\nMining \\n\\n122. It is my Government’s intention to encourage investment in mining sector \\nand promote sustainable mining practices to adequately meet the requirements \\nof industry without sacrificing environmental concerns. The current impasse in \\nmining sector, including, iron ore mining, will be resolved expeditiously. Changes, \\nif necessary, in the MMDR Act, 1957 would be introduced to facilitate this. \\nRevision of Royalty Rate \\n\\n123. There have been requests from several State Governments to revise rate \\nof Royalty on minerals. Hon’ble Members are aware that rate of Royalty can be \\nrevised after a period of three years. Last revision took place in August, 2009. \\nTherefore, another revision, which is due, will be undertaken to ensure greater \\nrevenue to the State Governments. \\n\\x0c\\n23 \\n\\nVI. FINANCIAL SECTOR \\nCapital Market \\n\\n124. Financial sector is at the heart of the growth engine. Globalization helps \\nchannelize external savings to India to bridge the resource gap but also renders \\nthe financial sector vulnerable to the vagaries of the global economy. We have \\nseen this in the recent past in ample measure. It is essential to strengthen and \\nmodernize the legislative regulatory framework. There are some important \\nrecommendations of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission like \\nthe enactment of the Indian Financial Code which is considered necessary for \\nbetter governance and accountability. It will be my endeavor to complete the \\nongoing process of consultations with all the stakeholders expeditiously on this. \\nIt is also essential to have a modern monetary policy framework to meet the \\nchallenge of an increasingly complex economy. Government will, in close \\nconsultation with the RBI, put in place such a framework. \\n125. While the impact of the above measures will be felt in the medium term, \\ntowards the same objective, I propose to: \\ni. Advise financial sector regulators to take early steps for a vibrant, \\ndeep and liquid corporate bond market and deepen the currency \\nderivatives market by eliminating unnecessary restrictions. \\nii. Extend a liberalized facility of 5% withholding tax to all bonds issued \\nby Indian corporate abroad for all sectors and extend the validity of \\nthe scheme to 30.06.2017. \\niii. Liberalize the ADR/GDR regime to allow issuance of depository \\nreceipts on all permissible securities. \\niv. Allow international settlement of Indian debt securities. \\nv. Completely revamp the Indian Depository Receipt (IDR) and \\nintroduce a much more liberal and ambitious Bharat Depository \\nReceipt (BhDR). \\nvi. Clarify the tax treatment on income of foreign fund whose fund \\nmanagers are located in India to resolve a long-standing problem. \\nDetails will be presented in Part B. \\n126. The Indian capital markets have been a source of risk capital for a growing \\nIndia. I propose to take a number of measures to further energize these markets \\nincluding: \\ni. Introduction of uniform KYC norms and inter-usability of the KYC \\nrecords across the entire financial sector. \\n\\x0c\\n24 \\n\\nii. Introduce one single operating demat account so that Indian financial \\nsector consumers can access and transact all financial assets through \\nthis one account. \\n127. As part of strengthening the regulatory framework for commodity markets, \\nthe Warehouse Development and Regulatory Authority (WD&RA) has begun a \\ntransformation plan to invigorate the warehousing sector and significantly \\nimprove post-harvest lending to farmers against negotiable warehouse receipts. \\nThis plan will be implemented with vigor. \\n128. There is an urgent need to converge the current Indian accounting \\nstandards with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). I propose \\nfor adoption of the new Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) by the Indian \\ncompanies from the financial year 2015-16 voluntarily and from the financial \\nyear 2016-17 on a mandatory basis. Based on the international consensus, the \\nregulators will separately notify the date of implementation of AS Ind for the \\nBanks, Insurance companies etc. Standards for the computation of tax would be \\nnotified separately. \\nBanking \\n\\n129. There have been some suggestions for consolidation of Public Sector \\nBanks. Government, in principle, agrees to consider these suggestions. \\n130. To provide all households in the country with banking services, a time \\nbound programme would be launched as Financial Inclusion Mission on 15 \\nAugust this year. It would particularly focus to empower the weaker sections of \\nthe society, including women, small and marginal farmers and labourers. Two \\nbank accounts in each household are proposed to be opened which will also be \\neligible for credit. \\n131. Long term financing for infrastructure has been a major constraint in \\nencouraging larger private sector participation in this sector. On the asset side, \\nbanks will be encouraged to extend long term loans to infrastructure sector with \\nflexible structuring to absorb potential adverse contingencies, sometimes known \\nas the 5/25 structure. On the liability side, banks will be permitted to raise long \\nterm funds for lending to infrastructure sector with minimum regulatory preemption \\nsuch as CRR, SLR and Priority Sector Lending (PSL). \\n132. After making suitable changes to current framework, a structure will be \\nput in place for continuous authorization of universal banks in the private sector \\nin the current financial year. RBI will create a framework for licensing small \\nbanks and other differentiated banks. Differentiated banks serving niche interests, \\nlocal area banks, payment banks etc. are contemplated to meet credit and \\nremittance needs of small businesses, unorganized sector, low income households, \\nfarmers and migrant work force. \\n\\x0c\\n25 \\n\\n133. The rising Non Performing Assets of Public Sector Banks is a matter of \\nconcern for the Government. Six new Debt Recovery Tribunals would be set up \\nat Chandigarh, Bengaluru, Ernakulum, Dehradun, Siliguri and Hyderabad. \\nGovernment will work out effective means for revival of other stressed assets. \\nInsurance Sector \\n\\n134. Benefits of insurance in India have not reached a large section of the \\npeople and insurance penetration and density are very low. The Government \\nwould work towards addressing this situation in multi-pronged manner with the \\nsupport of all stake holders concerned. This would include suitable incentives, \\nusing banking correspondents, strengthening micro-offices opened by public \\nsector insurance. It is also proposed to take up the pending insurance laws \\n(amendment) Bill for consideration of the Parliament. \\n135. As part of the legislative initiatives under financial sector reforms, it is \\nproposed to bridge the regulatory gap under the Prize Chits and Money Circulation \\nScheme (Banning) Act, 1978. This step is expected to facilitate effective regulation \\nof companies and entities which have duped a large number of poor and vulnerable \\npeople in this country. \\nSmall Savings \\n\\n136. To address the concerns of decline in savings rate and improving returns \\nfor small savers, I propose to revitalize small savings. \\n137. My Government attaches utmost importance to the welfare of Girl Child. \\nA special small savings instrument to cater to the requirements of educating and \\nmarriage of the Girl Child will be introduced. A National Savings Certificate \\nwith insurance cover will also be launched to provide additional benefits for the \\nsmall saver. \\n138. In the PPF Scheme, annual ceiling will be enhanced to `1.5 lakh p.a. \\nfrom ` 1 lakh at present. \\nVII. DEFENCE & INTERNAL SECURITY \\n139. There can be no compromise with the defence of our country. I therefore \\npropose to allocate an amount of ` 2,29,000 crore for the current financial year \\nfor Defence. \\nOne Rank One Pension \\n\\n140. We reaffirm our commitment to our brave soldiers. A policy of “One \\nRank One Pension” has been adopted by the Government to address the pension \\n\\x0c\\n26 \\n\\ndisparities. We propose to set aside a further sum of ` 1,000 crore to meet this \\nyear’s requirement. \\n\\nModernization \\n\\n141. Modernization of the armed forces is critical to enable them to play their \\nrole effectively in the Defence of India’s strategic interests. I, therefore, propose \\nto increase the capital outlay for Defence by ` 5,000 crore over the amount \\nprovided for in the interim Budget. This includes a sum of ` 1,000 crore for \\naccelerating the development of the Railway system in the border areas. Urgent \\nsteps would also be taken to streamline the procurement process to make it speedy \\nand more efficient. \\nWar Memorial \\n\\n142. The country is deeply indebted to the officers and the jawans of the armed \\nforces for having made huge sacrifices to defend its honour. In doing so a very \\nlarge number of them gave up their lives. It is a privilege for the nation to erect \\na befitting memorial in their memory. I am happy to announce that a War Memorial \\nwill be constructed in the Princes Park. It will be supplemented by a War Museum. \\nI am allocating a sum of ` 100 crore for this purpose. \\nThe Defence Production \\n\\n143. In the year 2011 a separate fund was announced to provide necessary \\nresources to public and private sector companies, including SMEs, as well as \\nacademic and scientific institutions to support research and development of \\nDefence systems that enhance cutting-edge technology capability in the country. \\nHowever, beyond the announcement, no action was taken. Therefore, I propose \\nto set aside an initial sum of ` 100 crore to set up a Technology Development \\nFund to support this objective. \\nInternal Security \\n\\n144. The scheme for modernization of state police forces would be reviewed. \\nI propose to enhance the allocation from a sum of ` 1,847 crore in the BE of \\n2013-14 to `3,000 crore in the current financial year. I am also allocating adequate \\nfunds for carrying out small but much needed developmental activities as \\nAdditional Central Assistance for Left Wing Extremist Affected districts. \\n145. In order to strengthen and modernize border infrastructure, a sum of \\n`2,250 crore has been set aside. In addition, a sum of `990 crore has been allocated \\nfor the socio economic development of the villages along the borders. A sum of \\n`150 crore has also been ear-marked for the construction of Marine Police Station, \\nJetties, for the purchase of boats etc. \\n\\x0c\\n27 \\n\\nNational Police Memorial \\n\\n146. The nation is equally indebted to the officers and the jawans of the Police \\nforces, including the central armed police forces, who are constantly engaging \\nwith the enemy within and in the process sacrificing their lives in the line of \\nduty. I announce the construction of a befitting National Police Memorial. I \\npropose to set aside a sum of ` 50 crores for this purpose in the current financial \\nyear. \\nVIII. CULTURE & TOURISM \\n147. India’s rich cultural, historical, religious and natural heritage provides a \\nhuge potential for the development of tourism and job creation as an Industry. \\nI propose to create 5 tourist circuits around specific themes and set aside a sum \\nof ` 500 crore for this purpose. \\n148. National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation \\nDrive (PRASAD) shall be launched in this financial year. A sum of ` 100 crore \\nis being set aside for this purpose. \\n149. National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana \\n(HRIDAY) will also be launched for conserving and preserving the heritage \\ncharacters of these cities. To begin with I propose to launch this programme in \\nthe cities such as Mathura, Amritsar, Gaya, Kanchipuram, Vellankani and Ajmer. \\nI propose to set aside a sum of ` 200 crore for this purpose. The Project will \\nwork through a partnership of Government, academic institutions and local \\ncommunity combining affordable technologies. \\n150. Archeological sites preservation requires urgent attention lest our ancient \\nheritage is lost to all future generations. For this purpose, I intend to set aside a \\nsum of `100 crore. \\n151. Sarnath-Gaya-Varanasi Buddhist circuit would also be developed with \\nworld class tourist amenities to attract tourists from all over the world. \\n152. Goa has emerged as a major international convention centre. It has also \\nbeen declared as the permanent venue for International Film Festival of India. \\nThere is an urgent need to develop world class convention facilities. This can \\nbest be done in close collaboration with the private sector. Government of India \\nwill fully support this initiative to develop the facilities in PPP mode through the \\nVGF scheme. \\nWater Resources and cleaning of Ganga \\n\\nLinking of Rivers \\n\\n153. Rivers form the lifeline of our country. They provide water not only for \\nproducing food for the multitudes but also drinking water. Unfortunately the \\n\\x0c\\n28 \\n\\ncountry is not uniformly blessed with perennial rivers. Therefore, an effort to \\nlink the rivers can give rich dividends to the country. It is time that we made a \\nserious effort to move in this direction. To expedite the preparation of the Detailed \\nProject Reports, I propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore. \\n\\nSacred Rivers \\n\\n154. Substantial amount of money has been spent in the conservation and \\nimprovement of the Ganga, which has a very special sacred place in the collective \\nconsciousness of this country. However, the efforts have not yielded desired \\nresults because of the lack of concerted effort by all the stakeholders. I propose \\nto set up Integrated Ganga Conservation Mission called “Namami Gange” and \\nset aside a sum of `2,037 crores for this purpose. \\nDevelopment of Ghats and beautification of Riverfront \\n\\n155. Our Riverfronts and Ghats are not only places of rich historical heritage \\nbut many of these are also sacred. To start this process in the country, I propose \\nto set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for Ghat development and beautification of \\nriver front at Kedarnath, Haridwar, Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad, Patna and Delhi \\nin the current financial year. \\nNRI Ganga Fund \\n\\n156. NRIs have been a very important contributor to the development process \\nin India, in areas such as education, health and preservation of culture. In this \\ncontext, to harness their enthusiasm to contribute towards the conservation of \\nthe river Ganga, NRI Fund for Ganga will be set up which will finance special \\nprojects. \\nScience and Technology \\n\\nTechnology Research Centres \\n\\n157. The Department of Science & Technology has some of country’s leading \\nresearch centres in the areas such as nanotechnology, materials science and biomedical \\ndevice technology. The government will strengthen at least five such \\ninstitutions as Technical Research Centres to make them more effective in the \\ninnovation space through Public Private Partnerships. \\nStimulating Investment In Biotechnology \\n\\n158. The development of biotech clusters in Faridabad and Bengaluru will be \\nscaled up and taken to the highest international quality. This effort will include \\nglobal partnerships in accessing model- organism resources for disease biology, \\nstem cell biology and for high-end electron microscopy. \\n\\x0c\\n29 \\n\\n159. The nascent agri-biotech cluster in Mohali will be scaled up to include \\nplant-genetic and phenotype platforms. Secondary agriculture will be a major \\nthrust in Mohali through collaborations in the public and private sector. In \\naddition, two new clusters, in Pune and Kolkata will be established. \\n160. Global partnerships will be developed under India’s leadership to \\ntransform the Delhi component of the International Centre for Genetic \\nEngineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) into a world-leader in life sciences \\nand biotechnology. \\nIndian Space Programme \\n\\n161. Several major space missions are planned for 2014-15 which include the \\nexperimental flight of India’s future heavy capacity launcher GSLV Mk-III, one \\ncommercial launch of PSLV and two more navigational satellites. \\n162. Our Mars Orbiter spacecraft is in its 300 days long voyage to Planet \\nMars along the designated helio-centric trajectory. Mars Orbiter Spacecraft is \\nexpected to be orbiting around Mars on September 24, 2014. \\nSports and Youth Affairs \\n\\nSports \\n\\n163. Sports are an integral part of growing up and personality development. \\nUnfortunately, in our country, sports have not been main-streamed to date. \\nGovernment will set up national level Sports Academies for major games in \\ndifferent parts of the country to mainstream sports.Academies with international \\nlevel facilities for training of accomplished athletes and for nurturing best talent \\nin the country at junior and sub-junior level will also be set up for Shooting, \\nArchery, Boxing, Wrestling, Weightlifting and various Track and field events. \\n164. Jammu & Kashmir has a lot of sporting talent which is not finding \\nexpression due to inadequate sports facilities. I propose to provide a sum of \\n`200 crore for upgrading the indoor and outdoor sports stadiums to international \\nstandards in Jammu and in Kashmir Valley. \\n165. I also propose to set up a sports university in Manipur. For this I am \\nproviding a sum of ` 100 crore in the current financial year. \\n166. Unique sports traditions have developed in the Himalayan region in the \\ncountries and the states that are a part of it. To promote these, India will start an \\nannual event to promote these games and would invite countries such as Nepal \\nand Bhutan also to participate in addition to the Indian states such as J&K, \\nUttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and the North Eastern States. \\n\\x0c\\n30 \\n\\n167. I also propose to set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for the training of our \\nsports women and men for the forthcoming Asian and Commonwealth games. \\nYouth \\n\\n168. Employment exchanges will be transformed into career centres and in \\naddition for providing information about job availability. These centers will also \\nextend counseling facilities to the youth for selecting the jobs best suited to their \\nability and aptitude. I have set aside a sum of ` 100 crore for this purpose. \\n169. Youth of India are pragmatic and forward looking and wish to be leaders \\nin all fields. In order to promote leadership skills, I propose to set up “A Young \\nLeaders Programme” with an initial allocation of ` 100 crore. \\nIX. OTHER PROPOSALS \\nDisplaced Kashmiri Migrants \\n\\n170. Displaced Kashmiri migrants require our special support for rehabilitation. \\nFor this, I intend to provide a sum of ` 500 crore in the current financial year. \\nConservation of Himalayas \\n\\n171. There is a great need to increase the capacity in the country for Himalayan \\nStudies. I propose to set up a National Centre for Himalayan Studies in \\nUttarakhand with an initial outlay of ` 100 crore. \\nAcademy for Customs \\n\\n172. It is proposed to set up the National Academy for Customs & Excise at \\nHindupur in Andhra Pradesh. \\nNorth Eastern States \\n\\nOrganic Food \\n\\n173. North Eastern Region of India has tremendous potential for development \\nof organic farming. With a growing global demand for organic food, people \\nliving in the NE states can reap rich harvest from development of commercial \\norganic farming. To facilitate this, I propose to provide a sum of ` 100 crore for \\nthis purpose in the current financial year. \\nNorth East Railway Connectivity \\n\\n174. North Eastern Region has suffered from under development and a sense \\nof isolation due to lack of proper connectivity. Development of rail system is \\n\\x0c\\n31 \\n\\nurgently required to bridge this gap. I intend to expedite the development of rail \\nconnectivity in the region and for this purpose I propose to set aside an additional \\nsum of ` 1,000 crore over and above the amount provided for in the interim \\nBudget. \\n\\n24x7 Channel for the North East \\n\\n175. TV is a very powerful tool for the expression of cultural identities and \\nfor creating greater awareness of the richness of the diversity of our country. To \\nprovide a strong platform to rich cultural and linguistic identity of the North-\\nEast, a new 24x7 channel called “Arun Prabha” will be launched. \\nAndhra Pradesh and Telangana \\n\\n176. My Government is committed to addressing the issues relating to \\ndevelopment of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the AP Re-organization Act, \\n2014. Provision has been made by various Ministries/Departments to fulfill the \\nobligation of Union Government for both the States. \\nNational Capital Territory of Delhi \\n\\n177. NCT of Delhi faces large in-migration every year. Delhi is plagued by \\nfrequent transmission related problems and issues of water distribution and supply. \\nIn order to overcome this and make Delhi a world class city, I propose to provide \\n` 200 crore for power reforms and ` 500 crore for water reforms. \\n178. In addition, to solve the long term water supply issues to the capital region, \\nconstruction of long pending Renuka Dam would be taken up on priority. I have \\nprovided an initial sum of ` 50 crore for this. \\nAndaman and Nicobar Island and Puducherry \\n\\n179. Andaman and Nicobar Island are part of our rich cultural heritage. In \\norder to tide over communication related problems of the Island, I propose to \\nallot a sum of ` 150 crore. \\n180. Similarly, I propose to provide ` 188 crore to Puducherry for meeting \\ncommitments for Disaster preparedness. \\nX. BUDGET ESTIMATES \\n181. I now turn to the Budget estimates for Main Budget 2014-15. We have \\ninherited a legacy, wherein, continuance of fiscal consolidation cannot be \\ncompromised while providing for the essential items. However, we have mandate \\nto fulfill for the people. Keeping this in mind we have prepared the estimates of \\nexpenditure and receipts for Financial Year 2014-15. \\n\\x0c\\n32 \\n\\n182. Non-Plan expenditure estimates for the Financial Year are ` 12,19,892 \\ncrore. While preparing Non-Plan estimates due care has been taken to fully provide \\nfor all the essential activities. Additional amounts have been provided for fertilizer \\nsubsidy and capital expenditure of Armed Forces. \\n183. While preparing estimates of plan expenditure, attention was paid to the \\nabsorptive capacity of the Department and on achieving greater outcome with \\nthe same financial outlay. In 2013-14, plan funds to the tune of `4,53,085 crore \\ncould be utilised. Plan allocation of ` 5,75,000 crore in the Main Budget \\n2014-15 mark an increase of 26.9% over actuals for 2013-14 and have been \\ntargeted towards Agriculture, capacity creation in Health and Education, Rural \\nRoads and National Highways Infrastructure, Railways network expansion, clean \\nenergy initiatives, development of water resources and river conservation plans. \\nFurther thorough convergence of programmes greater impact from the money \\nspent will be achieved. \\n184. Total expenditure estimates thus stands at ` 17,94,892 crore. \\n185. To finance this expenditure, it is estimated that Gross Tax receipts will \\nbe ` 13,64,524 crore. After devolving the share of states, share of centre will be \\n` 9,77,258 crore. Non Tax Revenues for the current Financial Year will be \\n`2,12,505 crore and capital receipts other than borrowings will be `73,952 crore. \\n186. With the above estimates, fiscal deficit will be 4.1% of GDP and Revenue \\ndeficit will be 2.9 per cent of GDP. \\n187. Hon’ble Members will recall that it was the initiative of the previous \\nNDA Government under Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which had made compulsory \\n10% allocation of plan funds for North Eastern Region and had made them Nonlapsable \\nin nature. From the current Budget, we have introduced a Statement \\nwhich will separately show plan allocation made for North Eastern Region. In \\nFinancial Year 2014-15, an allocation of ` 53,706 crore has been made for North \\nEastern Region. We have further made an allocation of ` 98,030 crore for women \\nand `81,075 crore for child welfare. \\n\\x0c\\n33 \\n\\nPART B \\n\\nXI. TAX PROPOSALS \\n188. Madam Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals. \\n189. Taxes are important for every economy to fund Government expenditure \\non security and welfare of its people. In the interim Budget 2014-15, my \\npredecessor had set revenue collection targets for direct taxes as well as indirect \\ntaxes, which appear to be ambitious. I propose to retain these targets and it shall \\nbe my endeavour to achieve the same. The impact of the tax changes now \\nproposed have of course been factored into the Budget Estimates, 2014-15. \\n190. While preparing the tax proposals, I had to encounter the challenge of an \\nextremely limited fiscal space. Nonetheless, I propose to introduce measures to \\nrevive the economy, promote investment in manufacturing sector and rationalize \\ntax provisions so as to reduce litigation as well as to address the problem of \\ninverted duty structure in certain areas. I also propose to give relief to individual \\ntaxpayers and to certain sectors of the economy. \\nDirect Taxes \\n\\n191. Let me begin with direct taxes. \\n192. Madam Speaker, I do not propose to make any change in the tax rate. \\nHowever, with a view to provide relief to small and marginal taxpayers and \\nsenior citizens, I propose to increase personal income tax exemption limit by \\n`50,000 that is, from `2 lakh to ` 2.5 lakh in the case of individual taxpayers \\nwho are below the age of 60 years. Similarly, I also propose to raise the exemption \\nlimit from `2.5 lakh to `3 lakh in the case of senior citizens. \\n193. I do not propose to make any change in the rate of surcharge either for \\nthe corporates or the individuals, HUFs, firms etc. \\n194. The education cess for all taxpayers shall continue at 3 percent. \\n195. In the year 2012-13 the gross domestic savings were 30.1% of the GDP \\nas compared to 33.7% in the year 2009-10. Increase in savings and their \\nproductive use leads to higher economic growth. The households are the main \\ncontributors to savings. Therefore, to encourage domestic investment in long \\n\\x0c\\n34 \\n\\nterm savings, I propose to increase the investment limit under section 80C of the \\nIncome-tax Act from ` 1 lakh to ` 1.5 lakh. \\n\\n196. Housing continues to be an area of concern for middle and lower middle \\nclass due to high cost of financing. Therefore, to reduce this burden, I propose \\nto increase the deduction limit on account of interest on loan in respect of self \\noccupied house property from ` 1.5 lakh to ` 2 lakh. \\n197. Infrastructure and construction sectors have a significant role in the \\neconomy. Growth in these sectors is necessary to revive the economy and generate \\njobs for millions of our young boys and girls. As stated earlier and with a view to \\nattract large scale investment in these sectors, I have provided a conducive tax \\nregime for Infrastructure Investment Trusts and Real Estate Investment Trusts to \\nbe set up in accordance with regulations of the Securities and Exchange Board \\nof India. \\n198. The manufacturing sector is of paramount importance for the growth of \\nour economy. This sector has multiplier effect on creation of jobs. Last year, an \\nincentive in the form of investment allowance to a manufacturing company that \\ninvests more than ` 100 crore in plant and machinery during the period from \\n01.04.2013 to 31.03.2015 was announced. Considering the need to incentivize \\nsmaller entrepreneurs, I propose to provide investment allowance at the rate of \\n15 percent to a manufacturing company that invests more than ` 25 crore in any \\nyear in new plant and machinery. This benefit will be available for three years \\ni.e. for investments upto 31.03.2017. The Scheme announced last year will \\ncontinue to operate in parallel till 31.03.2015. \\n199. I also propose to extend the investment linked deduction to two new \\nsectors, namely, slurry pipelines for the transportation of iron ore, and semiconductor \\nwafer fabrication manufacturing units. This will boost investment in \\nthese two critical sectors. \\n200. Supply of power continues to be a major area of concern for the country. \\nTherefore, instead of annual extensions, I propose to extend the 10 year tax \\nholiday to the undertakings which begin generation, distribution and transmission \\nof power by 31.03.2017. This stability in our policy will help the investors to \\nplan their investments better. \\n201. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have invested more than ` 8 lakh crore \\n(about 130 billion US $) in India. One of their concerns is uncertainty in taxation \\non account of characterization of their income. Moreover, the fund managers of \\nthese foreign investors remain outside India under the apprehension that their \\npresence in India may have adverse tax consequences. With a view to put an end \\n\\x0c\\n35 \\n\\nto this uncertainty and to encourage these fund managers to shift to India, \\nI propose to provide that income arising to foreign portfolio investors from \\ntransaction in securities will be treated as capital gains. \\n\\n202. The concessional rate of tax at 15 percent on dividends received by Indian \\ncompanies from their foreign subsidiaries has resulted in enhanced repatriation \\nof funds from abroad. I propose to continue with this concessional rate of 15 \\npercent on foreign dividends without any sunset date. This will ensure stability \\nof taxation policy. \\n203. In order to augment low cost long term foreign borrowings for Indian \\ncompanies, I propose to extend the eligible date of borrowing in foreign currency \\nfrom 30.06.2016 to 30.06.2017 for a concessional tax rate of 5 percent on interest \\npayments. I also propose to extend this tax incentive to all types of bonds instead \\nof only infrastructure bonds. I hope this measure will enable the companies to \\nstep up their investments in India. \\n204. In order to reduce litigation on transfer pricing issues, I propose to make \\ncertain changes in Transfer Pricing regulations. \\n(1) An Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) scheme was introduced in \\nthe year 2012. It has received good response. I propose to strengthen \\nthe administrative set up of APA to expedite disposal of applications. \\nFurther, I propose to introduce a “Roll Back” provision in the APA \\nscheme so that an APA entered into for future transactions may also \\nbe applied to international transactions undertaken in previous four \\nyears in specified circumstances. \\n(2) In order to align Transfer Pricing regulations in India with the best \\navailable practices, I propose to introduce range concept for \\ndetermination of arm’s length price. However, the arithmetic mean \\nconcept will continue to apply where number of comparable is \\ninadequate. The relevant data is under analysis and appropriate rules \\nwill be prescribed. \\n(3) As per existing provisions of Transfer Pricing Regulations, only one \\nyear data is allowed to be used for comparable analysis with some \\nexception. I propose to amend the regulations to allow use of multiple \\nyear data. \\nNecessary legislative amendments to give effect to the above proposals \\nincluding those relating to the Authority for Advance Rulings and Income-tax \\nSettlement Commission will be moved in the current session of the Parliament. \\n\\n\\x0c\\n36 \\n\\n205. In the case of Mutual Funds, other than equity oriented funds, the capital \\ngains arising on transfer of units held for more than a year is taxed at a concessional \\nrate of 10% whereas direct investments in banks and other debt instruments \\nattract a higher rate of tax. This allows tax arbitrage opportunity. This arbitrage \\nhas hardly benefitted retail investors as their percentage is very small among \\nsuch Mutual Fund investors. With a view to remove this tax arbitrage, I propose \\nto increase the rate of tax on long term capital gains from 10 percent to 20 percent \\non transfer of units of such funds. I also propose to increase the period of holding \\nin respect of such units from 12 months to 36 months for this purpose. \\n206. In the year 2003, the tax liability on income by way of dividends was \\nshifted from the shareholder to the company. The shareholder was required to \\npay tax on the gross dividends, but now the company pays tax on the dividend \\namount net of taxes. Similarly, in the case of Mutual Fund, income distribution \\ntax is paid on the income distributed net of taxes. I propose to remove this \\nanomaly both in the case of the company and the Mutual Fund. \\n207. Currently, where an assessee fails to deduct and pay tax on specified \\npayments to residents, 100 percent of such payments are not allowed as deduction \\nwhile computing his income. This has caused undue hardship to taxpayers, \\nparticularly where the rate of tax is only 1 to 10%. Hence, I propose to provide \\nthat instead of 100 percent, only 30% of such payments will be disallowed. \\n208. The Direct Taxes Code Bill, 2010 has lapsed with the dissolution of the \\n15th Lok Sabha. Having considered the report of the Standing Committee on \\nFinance and the views expressed by the stakeholders, my predecessor had placed \\na revised Code in the public domain in March, 2014. The Government shall \\nconsider the comments received from the stakeholders on the revised Code. The \\nGovernment will also review the DTC in its present shape and take a view in the \\nwhole matter. \\n209. Income-tax Department is expected to function not only as an enforcement \\nagency but also as a facilitator. A number of Aykar Seva Kendras (ASK) have \\nbeen opened in different parts of the country. I propose to extend this facility by \\nopening 60 more such Seva Kendras during the current financial year to promote \\nexcellence in service delivery. \\n210. The focus of any tax administration is to broaden the tax base. Our policy \\nthrust is to adopt non intrusive methods to achieve this objective. In this direction, \\nI propose to make greater use of information technology techniques. \\n211. Net Effect of the direct tax proposals is revenue loss of ` 22,200 crore. \\n\\x0c\\n37 \\n\\nIndirect Taxes \\n\\n212. I now turn to indirect taxes and shall begin with customs duties. \\n213. Manufacturing sector is under stress due to a variety of reasons. To boost \\ndomestic manufacture as also to address the issue of inverted duties, I propose to \\nreduce the basic customs duty (BCD) on: \\n• \\nFatty acids, crude palm stearin, RBD and other palm stearin, specified \\nindustrial grade crude oils from 7.5 percent to Nil for manufacture \\nof soaps and oleo-chemicals; \\n• \\nCrude glycerin from 12.5 percent to 7.5 percent and crude glycerin \\nused in the manufacture of soaps from 12.5 percent to Nil; \\n• \\nSteel grade limestone and steel grade dolomite from 5 percent to 2.5 \\npercent; \\n• \\nBattery waste and battery scrap from 10 percent to 5 percent; \\n• \\nCoal tar pitch from 10 percent to 5 percent; \\n• \\nSpecified inputs for manufacture of spandex yarn from 5 percent to \\nNil. \\n214. In order to encourage new investment and capacity addition in the \\nchemicals and petrochemicals sector, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty \\non reformate from 10 percent to 2.5 percent; on ethane, propane, ethylene, \\npropylene, butadiene and ortho-xylene from 5 percent to 2.5 percent; on methyl \\nalcohol and denatured ethyl alcohol from 7.5 percent to 5 percent; and on crude \\nnaphthalene from 10 percent to 5 percent. \\n215. The demand for electronics is growing very fast. To boost domestic \\nproduction and reduce our dependence on imports, I intend to take the following \\nsteps: \\n• \\nImpose basic customs duty at 10 percent on specified \\ntelecommunication products that are outside the purview of the \\nInformation Technology Agreement; \\n• \\nExempt all inputs/components used in the manufacture of personal \\ncomputers from 4 percent special additional duty (SAD); \\n• \\nImpose education cess on imported electronic products to provide \\nparity between domestically produced goods and imported goods; \\n• \\nExempt 4 percent SAD on PVC sheet and ribbon used for the \\nmanufacture of smart cards. \\n\\x0c\\n38 \\n\\n216. Cathode ray TVs are used by weaker sections who cannot afford to buy \\nmore expensive flat panel TVs. I propose to exempt colour picture tubes from \\nbasic customs duty to make cathode ray TVs cheaper. The duty concession will \\nhelp revive manufacturing of TVs in the SME sector and create employment \\nopportunities. At the same time, to encourage production of LCD and LED TVs \\nbelow 19 inches in India, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on LCD \\nand LED TV panels of below 19 inches from 10 percent to Nil. Further, to \\nencourage manufacture of LCD and LED TV panels, I propose to exempt from \\nbasic customs duty specified inputs used in their manufacture. \\n217. The domestic stainless steel industry is presently suffering from severe \\nunder-utilization of capacity. To give an impetus to the stainless steel industry, \\nI propose to increase the basic customs duty on imported flat-rolled products of \\nstainless steel from 5 percent to 7.5 percent. \\n218. We need to maximize our utilization of solar power. The existing duty \\nstructure incentivizes imports rather than domestic manufacture of solar \\nphotovoltaic cells and modules. Therefore, I propose to exempt from basic \\ncustoms duty: \\n• \\nspecified inputs for use in the manufacture of EVA sheets and back \\nsheets; \\n• \\nflat copper wire for the manufacture of PV ribbons. \\nA concessional basic customs duty of 5 percent is also being extended to \\nmachinery and equipment required for setting up of a project for solar energy \\nproduction. \\n\\n219. To promote wind energy, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty \\nfrom 10 percent to 5 percent on forged steel rings used in the manufacture of \\nbearings of wind operated electricity generators. Also, I propose to exempt the \\nSAD of 4 percent on parts and raw materials required for the manufacture of \\nwind operated generators. Further, I propose to prescribe a concessional basic \\ncustoms duty of 5 percent on machinery and equipment required for setting up \\nof compressed biogas plants (Bio-CNG). \\n220. I have only highlighted some of the proposals in the Budget 2014-15. \\nI am sure these measures would incentivize value addition, generate income and \\ncreate more jobs in India. \\n221. I have also undertaken several tax rationalization measures. At present, \\ncoal attracts customs duties at different rates. I propose to rationalize the duty \\nstructure on all non-agglomerated coal at 2.5 percent basic customs duty and 2 \\npercent CVD. Henceforth, anthracite coal, bituminous coal, coking coal, steam \\n\\x0c\\n39 \\n\\ncoal and other coal will attract the same duty. This will eliminate all assessment \\ndisputes and transaction costs associated with testing of various parameters of \\ncoal. \\n\\n222. Metallurgical coke is manufactured out of coking coal. The basic customs \\nduty on metallurgical coke is being increased from Nil to 2.5 percent in line with \\nthe duty on coking coal. \\n223. Ships imported for breaking up attract basic customs duty at 5 percent. \\nAs against this, melting scrap of iron or steel attracts basic customs duty at 2.5 \\npercent. I propose to rationalize the duty on ship breaking scrap and melting \\nscrap of iron or steel by reducing the basic customs duty on ships imported for \\nbreaking up from 5 percent to 2.5 percent. \\n224. Semi-processed, half cut or broken diamonds are presently exempt from \\nbasic customs duty. As against this, cut and polished diamonds and coloured \\ngemstones attract basic customs duty of 2 percent. To prevent mis-use and avoid \\nassessment disputes, the basic customs duty on semi-processed, half cut or broken \\ndiamonds, cut and polished diamonds and coloured gemstones is being \\nrationalized at 2.5 percent. To encourage exports, pre-forms of precious and \\nsemi-precious stones are being fully exempted from basic customs duty. \\n225. To encourage exports of readymade garments I propose to increase the \\nduty free entitlement for import of trimmings, embellishments and other specified \\nitems from 3 percent to 5 percent of the value of their exports. \\n226. Considering the need to conserve our natural resources, I propose to \\nincrease the export duty on bauxite from 10 percent to 20 percent. \\n227. The free baggage allowance under the baggage rules was last revised in \\n2012. As a measure of passenger facilitation, I propose to increase the free baggage \\nallowance from ` 35,000 to ` 45,000. \\n228. I shall now deal with excise duties. \\n229. To provide a fillip to the capital goods, consumer durables and automobile \\nsectors, and given our commitment to revive economic growth, I have already \\nextended the excise duty concessions beyond 30th June 2014 for a period of 6 \\nmonths up to 31st December 2014. We expect the industry to show positive \\nresults in the coming months. \\n230. In continuation, I have a few more proposals to boost domestic production. \\nMinimization of harvest and post harvest losses of agricultural produce is an \\nimportant measure for tackling food inflation and ensuring food security. The \\n\\x0c\\n40 \\n\\nlosses in fruits and vegetables are mainly due to lack of adequate processing \\ncapacity. To incentivize expansion of processing capacity, I propose to reduce \\nthe excise duty on specified food processing and packaging machinery from 10 \\npercent to 6 percent. \\n\\n231. As a measure of relief to the footwear industry, most of which are in \\nSME sector, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 12 percent to 6 percent on \\nfootwear of retail price exceeding ` 500 per pair but not exceeding ` 1,000 per \\npair. Footwear of retail price up to ` 500 per pair will continue to remain exempted. \\n232. I propose to withdraw the concessional excise duty (2 percent without \\nCenvat benefit and 6 percent with Cenvat benefit) on smart cards and levy a \\nuniform excise duty at 12 percent. Consequently, imports will attract higher CVD. \\nThis will help domestic industry. \\n233. To develop renewable sources of energy, I propose to exempt from excise \\nduty: \\n• \\nEVA sheets and solar back sheets and specified inputs used in their \\nmanufacture; \\n• \\nsolar tempered glass used in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic \\ncells and modules; \\n• \\nflat copper wire for the manufacture of PV ribbons for use in solar \\ncells and modules; \\n• \\nmachinery and equipment required for setting up of a project for \\nsolar energy production; \\n• \\nforged steel rings used in the manufacture of bearings of wind \\noperated generators; \\n• \\nmachinery and equipment required for setting up of compressed \\nbiogas plants (Bio-CNG). \\n234. To set at rest an on-going dispute, I propose to exempt PSF and PFY \\nmanufactured from plastic waste and scrap including PET bottles from excise \\nduty with effect from 29th June, 2010 to 7th May, 2012. I also propose to levy \\nprospectively a nominal duty of 2 percent without Cenvat benefit and 6 percent \\nwith Cenvat benefit on such PSF and PFY. \\n235. To encourage sports, I propose to prescribe a concessional excise duty of \\n2 percent without Cenvat benefit and 6 percent with Cenvat benefit on sports \\ngloves. \\n\\x0c\\n41 \\n\\n236. While undertaking all these measures, I also need to mobilize resources. \\nAccordingly, I propose to increase the specific excise duty on cigarettes in the \\nrange of 11 percent to 72 percent. Similar increases are proposed on cigars, \\ncheroots and cigarillos. Likewise, the excise duty is being increased from 12 \\npercent to 16 percent on pan masala, from 50 percent to 55 percent on \\nunmanufactured tobacco and from 60 percent to 70 percent on gutkha and chewing \\ntobacco. I also propose to levy an additional duty of excise at 5 percent on aerated \\nwaters containing added sugar. These are healthy measures and I hope everyone \\nwould welcome them from the point of view of human and fiscal health. \\n237. Clean Energy Cess is presently levied on coal, peat and lignite for the \\npurposes of financing and promoting clean energy initiatives and funding research \\nin the area of clean energy. I propose to expand the scope of purposes of levying \\nthe said cess to include financing and promoting clean environment initiatives \\nand funding research in the area of clean environment. To finance these additional \\ninitiatives, I propose to increase the Clean Energy Cess from ` 50 per tonne to \\n`100 per tonne. \\n238. I shall now deal with service tax. \\n239. In recent times, among indirect taxes, service tax has shown the highest \\nrate of growth. Since my overall objective is to prepare the indirect tax regime \\nfor a smooth transition to Goods and Services Tax, changes have been kept \\nminimal at this stage. The twin objectives in this sector of indirect taxes are to \\nwiden the tax base and enhance compliance. My proposals in relation to Service \\nTax are in line with these objectives. \\n240. To broaden the tax base in Service Tax, it is necessary to prune the negative \\nlist and exemptions to the extent possible. Accordingly, the negative list has \\nbeen reviewed and service tax leviable currently, on sale of space or time for \\nadvertisements in broadcast media, is being extended to cover such sales on \\nother segments like online and mobile advertising. Sale of space for \\nadvertisements in print media however would remain excluded from service \\ntax. Similarly, tax is being proposed on the service provided by radio-taxis to \\nplace them on par with rent-a-cab service. These new levies will come into effect \\nfrom a date to be notified after the passing of the Finance Bill. \\n241. In furtherance of the effort to broaden the tax base, certain exemptions \\nare being withdrawn, including those extended to services by air-conditioned \\ncontract carriages and technical testing of newly developed drugs on human \\nparticipants. \\n242. To spur growth in certain sectors, I have tried to correct the bottlenecks \\nwhich have been brought to my knowledge. Indian shipping industry had been \\n\\x0c\\n42 \\n\\nrepresenting that they are losing business in a tough global scenario, due to a \\nprovision in the Place of Provision of Services Rules, which is now being \\naddressed through an amendment. Similarly, to encourage growth in the transport \\nof goods through coastal vessels, the tax incidence is being reduced. In response \\nto the request of the tourism sector, services provided by Indian tour operators \\nto foreign tourists in relation to a tour wholly conducted outside India is being \\ntaken out of the tax net. A long standing demand of this sector has been to allow \\nCenvat credit for services of rent-a-cab and tour operators. I now propose to \\nallow credit in the same line of business. \\n\\n243. I had to accept a few requests for exemptions from the social sector, \\nsince exemption-induced distortion would be comparatively less in such sectors. \\nAt the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, service tax on loading, unloading, \\nstorage, warehousing and transportation of cotton, whether ginned or baled, is \\nbeing exempted to bring it on par with certain other agricultural produce. Services \\nprovided by the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation for the period prior to \\n1st July 2012 is being exempted. \\n244. For the benefit of the common man, the exemption presently available \\nfor specified micro insurance schemes is being expanded to cover all life micro-\\ninsurance schemes where the sum assured does not exceed ` 50,000 per life \\ninsured. Since taxes should not come in the way of safe disposal of medical and \\nclinical wastes, services provided by common bio-medical waste treatment \\nfacilities are being exempted. \\n245. Certain changes are also proposed for bringing about greater clarity and \\nfor reducing litigation regarding the scope of exemptions. These include functions \\nordinarily entrusted to a municipality and services in relation to education. \\n246. There are a few more decisions which entail small gains or losses of \\nrevenue. Certain amendments are also being proposed in the Customs and Central \\nExcise Acts and in the Finance Act, 1994 relating to service tax. These changes \\nare reflected in the budget documents. \\n247. My tax proposals on the indirect taxes side are estimated to yield ` 7,525 \\ncrore. \\n248. I have some more proposals which are in the nature of facilitating trade \\nand resolving disputes. I shall highlight only a few. \\n249. Faster clearance of import and export cargo reduces transaction costs \\nand improves business competitiveness. To help achieve these objectives, \\nmeasures are being initiated to extend the existing 24x7 customs clearance facility \\n\\x0c\\n43 \\n\\nto 13 more airports in respect of all export goods and to 14 more sea ports in \\nrespect of specified import and export goods. \\n\\n250. It is also proposed to implement an ‘Indian Customs Single Window \\nProject’ to facilitate trade. Under this, importers and exporters would lodge their \\nclearance documents at a single point only. Required permissions, if any, from \\nother regulatory agencies would be obtained online without the trader having to \\napproach these agencies. This would reduce interface with Governmental \\nagencies, dwell time and the cost of doing business. \\n251. The scheme of Advance Ruling in indirect taxes is being expanded to \\ncover resident private limited companies. This will allow these companies to \\nseek advance ruling in respect of new activities being proposed to be undertaken \\nby them. The scope of Settlement Commission is being enlarged to facilitate \\nquick dispute resolution. \\n252. To expedite the process of disposal of appeals, amendments have been \\nproposed in the Customs and Central Excise Acts with a view to freeing appellate \\nauthorities from hearing stay applications and to take up regular appeals for final \\ndisposal. \\n253. Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Budget to the House.', 'CONTENTS \\n\\nPART -A \\n\\nPage No. \\nIntroduction 1 \\nMajor Challenges Ahead 5 \\nFiscal Roadmap 6 \\nGood Goverance 6 \\nAgriculture 7 \\nFunding the Unfunded 8 \\nFrom Jan Dhan to Jan Suraksha 9 \\nInfrastructure 10 \\nFinancial Markets 12 \\nMonetising Gold 13 \\nInvestment 14 \\nSafe India 14 \\nTourism 14 \\nGreen India 15 \\nSkill India 15 \\nDigital India 17 \\nBudget Estimates 18 \\n\\nPART -B \\n\\nTAX PROPOSALS 19 \\n\\nConclusion 27 \\n\\nAnnexure 28 \\nAnnexure to Part - B \\n\\n(a) Direct Taxes 30 \\n\\n(b) Indirect Taxes \\n\\n36 \\n\\n\\x0c\\nBudget 2015-2016 \\n\\nSpeech of \\n\\nArun Jaitley \\n\\nMinister of Finance \\n\\nFebruary 28, 2015 \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\nI rise to present the Budget of the Union for the year 2015-16. \\n\\n2. I present this Budget in an economic environment which is far more \\npositive than in the recent past. When other economies are facing serious \\nchallenges, India is about to take-off on a faster growth trajectory once again. \\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded its earlier forecast of \\nglobal economic growth by 0.3%, and the World Trade Organization has revised \\nits forecast of world trade growth from 5.3% to 4%. Forecasts for India, however, \\nhave either been upgraded, or remained the same, without downgrades. Madam \\nSpeaker, we have also embraced the States as equal partners in the process of \\neconomic growth. States have been economically empowered more than ever \\nbefore and it is my belief that every rupee of public expenditure, whether \\nundertaken by the Centre or the States, will contribute to the betterment of people’s \\nlives through job creation, poverty elimination and economic growth. \\n3. In the last nine months, the NDA Government headed by Prime Minister \\nShri Narendra Modi, has undertaken several significant steps to energise the \\neconomy. The credibility of the Indian economy has been re-established. The \\nworld is predicting that it is India’s chance to fly. \\nKuch to phool khilaye humne, aur kuch phool khilane hai \\nMushkil yeh hai bag me ab tak, kaante kai purane hai \\n\\n4. Though the Union Budget is essentially a Statement of Account of public \\nfinances, it has historically become a significant opportunity to indicate the \\ndirection and the pace of India’s economic policy. My proposals, therefore, lay \\nout the roadmap for accelerating growth, enhancing investment and passing on \\nthe benefit of the growth process to the common man, woman, youth and child: \\nthose, whose quality of life needs to be improved. This is the path which we will \\n\\x0c\\n2 \\n\\ndoggedly and relentlessly pursue. As the Prime Minister has often said, we are a \\nround-the-clock, round-the-year Government. \\n\\n5. Madam, allow me to describe the changes in the Indian economy since \\nwe first took office. In November, 2012, CPI inflation, stood at 11.2%, the \\ncurrent account deficit by the first quarter of 2013-14 had reached 4.6% of GDP, \\nand normal foreign inflows until March 2014 were $15 billion. We inherited a \\nsentiment of, if I may say so, doom and gloom, and the investor community had \\nalmost written us off. \\n6. We have come a long way since then. The latest CPI inflation rate is \\n5.1%, and the wholesale price inflation is negative; the current account deficit \\nfor this year is expected to be below 1.3% of GDP; based on the new series, real \\nGDP growth is expected to accelerate to 7.4%, making India the fastest growing \\nlarge economy in the world; foreign inflows since April 2014 have been about \\n$55 billion, so that our foreign exchange reserves have increased to a record \\n$340 billion; the rupee has become stronger by 6.4% against a broad basket of \\ncurrencies; and ours was the second-best performing stock market amongst the \\nmajor economies. In short, Madam Speaker, we have turned around the economy \\ndramatically, restoring macro-economic stability and creating the conditions for \\nsustainable poverty elimination, job creation and durable double-digit economic \\ngrowth. Domestic and international investors are seeing us with renewed interest \\nand hope. \\n7. While being mindful of the challenges, Madam Speaker, this gives us \\nreason to feel optimistic. With all the humility at my command, I submit that this \\nopportunity has arisen because we have created it. The people of India had voted \\nresoundingly for quick change, faster growth and highest levels of transparency. \\nThey wanted the scam, scandal and corruption Raj to end. They wanted a \\nGovernment in which they can trust. We have lived up to that trust. \\n8. Our actions have not been confined to the core or macro-economic areas \\nalone. Illustratively, action has been taken with regard to allocation of natural \\nresources; financial inclusion; health and hygiene of the common man; girls and \\ntheir education; employment for the youth; improved and non-adversarial tax \\nadministration; effective delivery of benefits; investment and job creation; welfare \\nof labour; agricultural productivity and increasing farm incomes; power; digital \\nconnectivity; skilling our youth; efficient and better work culture in Government; \\nease of doing business; mainstreaming North Eastern States; and, reviving our \\npride in the nation and culture. I am giving the details in an Annexure to this \\nspeech. \\n9. Madam Speaker, of the work that we have done, I would like to talk of \\nthree achievements as they demonstrate the quality and conviction of our \\ngovernment. One is the success of the Jan Dhan Yojana. Financial inclusion has \\n\\x0c\\n3 \\n\\nbeen talked about for decades now. Who would have thought that in a short \\nperiod of 100 days, over 12.5 crore families could have been brought into the \\nfinancial mainstream? The other is coal auctions. Earlier, the States only got \\nbenefits of royalty. Now, by the transparent auction process that we are carrying \\nout, the coal bearing States will be getting several lakh of crore of rupees which \\nthey can use for creation of long awaited community assets and for welfare of \\ntheir people. \\n\\n10. The third is ‘Swachh Bharat’ which we have been able to transform into \\na movement to regenerate India. I can speak of, for example, the 50 lakh toilets \\nalready constructed in 2014-15, and I can also assure the Members of this august \\nHouse that we will indeed attain the target of building six crore toilets. But, \\nMadam, Swachh Bharat is not only a programme of hygiene and cleanliness but, \\nat a deeper level, a programme for preventive health care, and building awareness. \\n11. We are now embarked on two more game changing reforms. GST and \\nwhat the Economic Survey has called the JAM Trinity – Jan Dhan, Aadhar and \\nMobile – to implement direct transfer of benefits. GST will put in place a state-\\nof-the-art indirect tax system by 1st April, 2016. The JAM Trinity will allow us \\nto transfer benefits in a leakage-proof, well-targetted and cashless manner. \\n12. Madam Speaker, one of the major achievements of my government has \\nbeen to conquer inflation. This decline, in my view, represents a structural shift. \\nGoing forward, we expect CPI inflation to remain at close to 5% by the end of \\nthe year. This will allow for further easing of monetary policy. \\n13. To ensure that our victory over inflation is institutionalized and hence \\ncontinues, we have concluded a Monetary Policy Framework Agreement with \\nthe RBI, as I had promised in my Budget Speech for 2014-15. This Framework \\nclearly states the objective of keeping inflation below 6%. We will move to \\namend the RBI Act this year, to provide for a Monetary Policy Committee. \\n14. The Central Statistics Office has recently released a new series for GDP, \\nwhich involves a number of changes relative to the old series. Based on the new \\nseries, estimated GDP growth for 2014-15 is 7.4%. Growth in 2015-16 is expected \\nto be between 8 to 8.5%. Aiming for a double-digit rate seems feasible very \\nsoon. \\n15. I now come to the task ahead of us. In respect of social and economic \\nindicators, for seven decades now, we have worked in terms of percentages, and \\nnumbers of beneficiaries covered. It is quite obvious that incremental change is \\nnot going to take us anywhere. We have to think in terms of a quantum jump. \\n16. The year 2022 will be the Amrut Mahotsav, the 75th year, of India’s \\nindependence. The vision of what the Prime Minister has called ‘Team India’, \\nled by the States and guided by the Central Government, should include: \\n\\x0c\\n4 \\n\\n(i) A roof for each family in India. The call given for ‘Housing for \\nall’ by 2022 would require Team India to complete 2 crore houses \\nin urban areas and 4 crore houses in rural areas. \\n(ii) Each house in the country should have basic facilities of 24-hour \\npower supply, clean drinking water, a toilet, and be connected to \\na road. \\n(iii) At least one member from each family should have access to the \\nmeans for livelihood and, employment or economic opportunity, \\nto improve his or her lot. \\n(iv) Substantial reduction of poverty. All our schemes should focus \\non and centre around the poor. Each of us has to commit ourselves \\nto this task of eliminating absolute poverty. \\n(v) Electrification, by 2020, of the remaining 20,000 villages in the \\ncountry, including by off-grid solar power generation. \\n(vi) Connecting each of the 1,78,000 unconnected habitations by all \\nweather roads. This will require completing 1,00,000 km of roads \\ncurrently under construction plus sanctioning and building another \\n1,00,000 km of road. \\n(vii) Good health is a necessity for both quality of life, and a person’s \\nproductivity and ability to support his or her family. Providing \\nmedical services in each village and city is absolutely essential. \\n(viii) Educating and skilling our youth to enable them to get employment \\nis the altar before which we must all bow. To ensure that there is \\na senior secondary school within 5 km reach of each child, we \\nneed to upgrade over 80,000 secondary schools and add or upgrade \\n75,000 junior/middle, to the senior secondary level. We also have \\nto ensure that education improves in terms of quality and learning \\noutcomes. \\n(ix) Increase in agricultural productivity and realization of reasonable \\nprices for agricultural production is essential for the welfare of \\nrural areas. We should commit to increasing the irrigated area, \\nimproving the efficiency of existing irrigation systems, promoting \\nagro-based industry for value addition and increasing farm \\nincomes, and reasonable prices for farm produce. \\n(x) In terms of communication, the rural and urban divide should no \\nlonger be acceptable to us. We have to ensure connectivity to all \\nthe villages without it. \\n\\x0c\\n5 \\n\\n(xi) Two-thirds of our population is below 35. To ensure that our \\nyoung get proper jobs, we have to aim to make India the \\nmanufacturing hub of the world. The Skill India and the Make in \\nIndia programmes are aimed at doing this. \\n(xii) We also have to encourage and grow the spirit of entrepreneurship \\nin India and support new start-ups. Thus can our youth turn from \\nbeing job-seekers, to job-creators. \\n(xiii) The Eastern and North Eastern regions of our country are lagging \\nbehind in development on many fronts. We need to ensure that \\nthey are on par with the rest of the country. \\n17. By the time of the 75th year of Indian independence, Amrut Mahotsav of \\nour independence is reached, we have to achieve all of the above, so that India \\nbecomes a prosperous country; and a responsible global power. This will be our \\ntrue and meaningful tribute to our freedom fighters. \\nMajor Challenges Ahead \\n\\n18. As I stated earlier, Madam Speaker, I am also mindful of the five major \\nchallenges I have to reckon with. Firstly, Agricultural incomes are under stress. \\nOur second challenge is increasing investment in infrastructure. With private \\ninvestment in infrastructure via the public private partnership (PPP) model still \\nweak, public investment needs to step in, to catalyse investment. \\n19. Our third major challenge is that manufacturing has declined from 18% \\nto 17% of GDP as per new GDP data; and manufacturing exports have remained \\nstagnant at about 10% of GDP. The Make in India programme is aimed at meeting \\nthis challenge, thus creating jobs. \\n20. Fourth, we need to be mindful of the need for fiscal discipline in spite of \\nrising demands for public investment. In keeping with the true spirit of cooperative \\nfederalism, we have devolved a 42% share of the divisible pool of \\ntaxes to States. As members of this august House are aware, this is an \\nunprecedented increase which would empower states with more resources. The \\ndevolution to the States would be of the order of `5.24 lakh crore in 2015-16 as \\nagainst the devolution of `3.38 lakh crore as per revised estimates of 2014-15. \\nAnother `3.04 lakh crore would be transferred by way of grants and plan transfers. \\nThus, total transfer to the States will be about 62% of the total tax receipts of the \\ncountry. \\n21. In spite of the consequential reduced fiscal space for the Centre, the \\nGovernment has decided to continue supporting important national priorities \\nsuch as agriculture, education, health, MGNREGA, and rural infrastructure \\nincluding roads. Programmes targeted for the poor and the under-privileged, \\nwill be continued by us. \\n\\x0c\\n6 \\n\\n22. With fiscal space not just reduced but squeezed, I have to meet the fifth \\nchallenge of maintaining fiscal discipline. Economic growth this year, at 11.5%, \\nwas lower in nominal terms by about 2%, due to lower inflation. Consequently, \\ntax buoyancy was also significantly lower. Despite this, Madam, I have kept my \\nword, and we will meet the challenging fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP, that \\nwe had inherited. Madam Speaker, I need to overcome these challenges to reduce \\nand eliminate poverty. \\nFiscal Roadmap \\n\\n23. I want to underscore that my government still remains firm on achieving \\nthe medium term target of 3% of GDP. But that journey has to take account of \\nthe need to increase public investment. The total additional public investment \\nover and above the RE is planned to be `1.25 lakh crore out of which `70,000 \\ncrore would be capital expenditure from budgetary outlays. We also have to \\ntake into account the drastically reduced fiscal space; uncertainties that \\nimplementation of GST will create; and the likely burden from the report of the \\n7th Pay Commission. Rushing into, or insisting on, a pre-set time-table for \\nfiscal consolidation pro-cyclically would, in my opinion, not be pro-growth. With \\nthe economy improving, the pressure for accelerated fiscal consolidation too has \\ndecreased. In these circumstances, I will complete the journey to a fiscal deficit \\nof 3% in 3 years, rather than the two years envisaged previously. Thus, for the \\nnext three years, my targets are: 3.9%, for 2015-16; 3.5% for \\n2016-17; and, 3.0% for 2017-18. The additional fiscal space will go towards \\nfunding infrastructure investment. \\n24. I am moving amendments accordingly, in the Finance Bill, to the FRBM \\nAct. \\n25. Madam Speaker, I want to round up the discussion on the fiscal road \\nmap on an optimistic note. While there is a compositional shift, the aggregate \\nenvelope for job creation, poverty elimination and building infrastructure is not \\ndisturbed; in fact it goes up this year, and every subsequent year, in the same \\nproportion as the tax revenues of the Union, and the State Governments increase. \\nFrom this national perspective of public finances, not only is the path to fiscal \\nconsolidation on track, aggregate annual capital expenditure of the Governments, \\nas a whole, can be expected to rise significantly, by more than 0.5% of GDP. \\n26. Madam Speaker, it may be noted that the budget reflects considerable \\nscaling up of disinvestment figures. This will include both disinvestment in loss \\nmaking units, and some strategic disinvestment. \\nGood Governance \\n\\n27. Madam, Speaker, this Government is committed in its resolve, as Indians, \\nto regain our pre-eminence as a just and compassionate country. Well-intentioned \\n\\x0c\\n7 \\n\\nschemes introduced in the past, have often been ill-targeted, riddled with leakages \\nand delivered with inefficiency. The same is true of subsidies. Subsidies are \\nneeded for the poor and those less well off. What we need is a well targeted \\nsystem of subsidy delivery. We need to cut subsidy leakages, not subsidies \\nthemselves.We are committed to the process of rationalizing subsidies based on \\nthis approach. \\n\\n28. We have embarked on that path. The direct transfer of benefits, started \\nmostly in scholarship schemes, will be further expanded with a view to increasing \\nthe number of beneficiaries from the present 1 crore to 10.3 crore. Similarly, \\n`6,335 crore have so far been transferred directly, as LPG subsidy to 11.5 crore \\nLPG consumers. I am sure, persons who are better-off, such as those in the top \\ntax bracket, and those genuinely concerned for the welfare of the poor, such as \\nmembers of this House, will give up their LPG subsidy voluntarily. \\nAgriculture \\n\\n29. Our commitment to farmers runs deep. We have already taken major \\nsteps to address the two major factors critical to agricultural production: soil and \\nwater. An ambitious Soil Health Card Scheme has been launched to improve \\nsoil fertility on a sustainable basis. In order to improve soil health, I also propose \\nto support Agiculture Ministry’s organic farming scheme – “Paramparagat Krishi \\nVikas Yojana”. The Pradhanmantri Gram Sinchai Yojana is aimed at irrigating \\nthe field of every farmer and improving water use efficiency to provide `Per \\nDrop More Crop’. I am allocating `5,300 crore to support micro-irrigation, \\nwatershed development and the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana. I urge \\nthe States to chip in substantially in this vital sector. \\n30. To support the agriculture sector with the help of effective and hassle-\\nfree agriculture credit, with a special focus on small and marginal farmers, \\nI propose to allocate `25,000 crore in 2015-16 to the corpus of Rural Infrastructure \\nDevelopment Fund (RIDF) set up in NABARD; `15,000 crore for Long Term \\nRural Credit Fund; `45,000 crore for Short Term Cooperative Rural Credit \\nRefinance Fund; and `15,000 crore for Short Term RRB Refinance Fund. \\n31. Farm credit underpins the efforts of our hard-working farmers. I have, \\ntherefore, set up an ambitious target of `8.5 lakh crore of credit during the year \\n2015-16 which, I am sure, the banks will surpass. \\n32. Our government is committed to supporting employment through \\nMGNREGA. We will ensure that no one who is poor is left without employment. \\nWe will focus on improving the quality and effectiveness of activities under \\nMGNREGA. I have made an initial allocation of `34,699 crore for the \\nprogramme. \\n\\x0c\\n8 \\n\\n33. While the farmer is no longer in the clutches of the local trader, his produce \\nstill does not command the best national price. To increase the incomes of farmers, \\nit is imperative that we create a National agricultural market, which will have \\nthe incidental benefit of moderating price rises. I intend this year to work with \\nthe States, in NITI, for the creation of a Unified National Agriculture Market. \\nFunding the Unfunded \\n\\n34. Madam Speaker, our government firmly believes that development \\nhas to generate inclusive growth. While large corporate and business entities \\nhave a role to play, this has to be complemented by informal sector enterprises \\nwhich generate maximum employment. There are some 5.77 crore small business \\nunits, mostly individual proprietorship, which run small manufacturing, trading \\nor service businesses. 62% of these are owned by SC/ST/OBC. These bottom-\\nof-the-pyramid, hard-working entrepreneurs find it difficult, if not impossible, \\nto access formal systems of credit. I, therefore, propose to create a Micro Units \\nDevelopment Refinance Agency (MUDRA) Bank, with a corpus of `20,000 \\ncrore, and credit guarantee corpus of `3,000 crore. MUDRA Bank will refinance \\nMicro-Finance Institutions through a Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. In lending, \\npriority will be given to SC/ST enterprises. These measures will greatly increase \\nthe confidence of young, educated or skilled workers who would now be able to \\naspire to become first generation entrepreneurs; existing small businesses, too, \\nwill be able to expand their activities. Just as we are banking the un-banked, we \\nare also funding the un-funded. \\n35. A significant part of the working capital requirement of a MSME arises \\ndue to long receivables realization cycles. We are in the process of establishing \\nan electronic Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) financing of trade \\nreceivables of MSMEs, from corporate and other buyers, through multiple \\nfinanciers. This should improve the liquidity in the MSME sector significantly. \\n36. Bankruptcy law reform, that brings about legal certainty and speed, has \\nbeen identified as a key priority for improving the ease of doing business. SICA \\n(Sick Industrial Companies Act) and BIFR (Bureau for Industrial and Financial \\nReconstruction) have failed in achieving these objectives. We will bring a \\ncomprehensive Bankruptcy Code in fiscal 2015-16, that will meet global standards \\nand provide necessary judicial capacity. \\n37. The Government is committed to increasing access of the people to the \\nformal financial system. In this context, Government proposes to utilize the \\nvast Postal network with nearly 1,54,000 points of presence spread across the \\nvillages of the country. I hope that the Postal Department will make its proposed \\nPayments Bank venture successful so that it contributes further to the Pradhan \\nMantri Jan Dhan Yojana. \\n\\x0c\\n9 \\n\\n38. To bring parity in regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies \\n(NBFCs) with other financial institutions in matters relating to recovery, it is \\nproposed that NBFCs registered with RBI and having asset size of `500 crore \\nand above will be considered for notifications as ‘Financial Institution’ in terms \\nof the SARFAESI Act, 2002. \\nFrom Jan Dhan to Jan Suraksha \\n\\n39. A large proportion of India’s population is without insurance of any kind \\n-health, accidental or life. Worryingly, as our young population ages, it is also \\ngoing to be pension-less. Encouraged by the success of the Pradhan Mantri Jan \\nDhan Yojana, I propose to work towards creating a universal social security \\nsystem for all Indians, specially the poor and the under-privileged. \\n40. The soon-to-be-launched Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna will cover \\naccidental death risk of `2 lakh for a premium of just `12 per year. Similarly, we \\nwill also launch the Atal Pension Yojana, which will provide a defined pension, \\ndepending on the contribution, and its period. To encourage people to join this \\nscheme, the Government will contribute 50% of the beneficiaries’ premium \\nlimited to `1,000 each year, for five years, in the new accounts opened before \\n31st December, 2015. \\n41. The third Social Security Scheme that I wish to announce is the Pradhan \\nMantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana which covers both natural and accidental death \\nrisk of `2 lakhs. The premium will be `330 per year, or less than one rupee per \\nday, for the age group 18-50. \\n42. There are unclaimed deposits of about `3,000 crore in the PPF, and \\napproximately `6,000 crore in the EPF corpus. I have proposed the creation of \\na Senior Citizen Welfare Fund, in the Finance Bill, for appropriation of these \\namounts to a corpus which will be used to subsidize the premiums of vulnerable \\ngroups such as old age pensioners, BPL card-holders, small and marginal farmers \\nand others. A detailed scheme would be issued in March. \\n43. Madam Speaker, special regard needs to be paid to the population of \\nsenior citizens in the country which is now approximately 10.5 crore, out of \\nwhich over one crore are above the age of 80 years. 70% live in rural areas and \\na large number are in the BPL category. A sizeable percentage of them also \\nsuffer from age related disabilities. Ours is a society that venerates its elders. \\nI, therefore, propose that a new scheme for providing Physical Aids and Assisted \\nLiving Devices for senior citizens, living below the poverty line. \\n44. In sum, these social security schemes reflect our commitment to utilize \\nthe Jan Dhan platform, to ensure that no Indian citizen will have to worry about \\nillness, accidents, or penury in old age. Being sensitive to the needs of the poor, \\nunder-privileged and the disadvantaged, my Government also remains committed \\n\\x0c\\n10 \\n\\nto the ongoing welfare schemes for the SCs, STs and Women. Despite serious \\nconstraints on Union finances, allocations made this year are as follows: \\n\\nSC ` 30,851 crore \\nST ` 19,980 crore \\nWomen ` 79,258 crore \\n\\n45. An integrated education and livelihood scheme called ‘Nai Manzil’ will \\nbe launched this year to enable Minority Youth who do not have a formal school-\\nleaving certificate to obtain one and find better employment. Further, to showcase \\ncivilization and culture of the Parsis, the Government will support, in \\n2015-16, an exhibition, ‘The Everlasting Flame’. The allocation for the Ministry \\nof Minority Affairs is being protected. The BE for the year 2015-16 is `3,738 \\ncrore. \\nInfrastructure \\n\\n46. Madam, it is no secret that the major slippage in the last decade has been \\non the infrastructure front. Our infrastructure does not match our growth \\nambitions. There is a pressing need to increase public investment. I have, \\ntherefore, increased outlays on both the roads and the gross budgetary support to \\nthe railways, by `14,031 crore, and `10,050 crore respectively. The CAPEX of \\nthe public sector units is expected to be ` 3,17,889 crore, an increase of \\napproximately `80,844 crore over RE 2014-15. In fact, all told, investment in \\ninfrastructure will go up by `70,000 crore in the year 2015-16, over the year \\n2014-15 from the Centre’s Funds and resources of CPSEs. \\n47. Secondly, I intend to establish a National Investment and Infrastructure \\nFund (NIIF), and find monies to ensure an annual flow of ` 20,000 crore to it. \\nThis will enable the Trust to raise debt, and in turn, invest as equity, in \\ninfrastructure finance companies such as the IRFC and NHB. The infrastructure \\nfinance companies can then leverage this extra equity, many fold. Thirdly, I also \\nintend to permit tax free infrastructure bonds for the projects in the rail, road and \\nirrigation sectors. Fourth, the PPP mode of infrastructure development has to be \\nrevisited, and revitalised. The major issue involved is rebalancing of risk. In \\ninfrastructure projects, the sovereign will have to bear a major part of the risk \\nwithout, of course, absorbing it entirely. \\n48. Fifth, I also intend to establish, in NITI, the Atal Innovation Mission \\n(AIM). AIM will be an Innovation Promotion Platform involving academics, \\nentrepreneurs, and researchers and draw upon national and international \\nexperiences to foster a culture of innovation, R&D and scientific research in \\nIndia. The platform will also promote a network of world-class innovation hubs \\nand Grand Challenges for India. Initially, a sum of `150 crore will be earmarked \\nfor this purpose. \\n\\x0c\\n11 \\n\\n49. India has a well regarded and world-class IT industry with revenues of \\nabout US$ 150 billion, over US$ 100 billion of exports, employing nearly 40 \\nlakh people directly. We are now seeing a growing interest in start-ups. \\nExperimenting in cutting edge technologies, creating value out of ideas and \\ninitiatives and converting them into scalable enterprises and businesses is at the \\ncore of our strategy for engaging our youth and for inclusive and sustainable \\ngrowth of the country. Concerns such as a more liberal system of raising global \\ncapital, incubation facilities in our Centres of Excellence, funding for seed capital \\nand growth, and ease of Doing Business etc. need to be addressed to create lakh \\nof jobs and hundreds of billion dollars in value. \\n50. With this objective, Government is establishing a mechanism to be \\nknown as SETU (Self-Employment and Talent Utilisation). SETU will be a \\nTechno-Financial, Incubation and Facilitation Programme to support all aspects \\nof start-up businesses, and other self-employment activities, particularly in \\ntechnology-driven areas. I am setting aside `1,000 crore initially in NITI Aayog \\nfor this purpose. \\n51. As the success of so-called minor ports has shown, ports can be an \\nattractive investment possibility for the private sector. Ports in the public sector \\nneed to both attract such investment as well as leverage the huge land resources \\nlying unused with them. To enable us to do so, ports in public sector will be \\nencouraged, to corporatize, and become companies under the Companies Act. \\n52. Madam Speaker, investors spend a large amount of time and resources \\non getting the multiple permissions required. We aim towards ease of doing in \\nIndia. I have myself launched the e-Biz Portal which integrates 14 regulatory \\npermissions at one source. Good States are embracing and joining this platform. \\nHowever, if we really want to create jobs, we have to make India an investment \\ndestination which permits the start of a business in accordance with publically \\nstated guidelines and criteria. \\n53. I intend to appoint an Expert Committee for this purpose to examine the \\npossibility and prepare a draft legislation where the need for multiple prior \\npermissions can be replaced with a pre-existing regulatory mechanism. \\n54. The Government also proposes to set up 5 new Ultra Mega Power Projects, \\neach of 4000 MWs in the plug-and-play mode. All clearances and linkages will \\nbe in place before the project is awarded by a transparent auction system. This \\nshould unlock investments to the extent of ` 1 lakh crore. The Government \\nwould also consider similar plug-and-play projects in other infrastructure projects \\nsuch as roads, ports, rail lines, airports etc. I am happy to announce that the \\nsecond unit of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Station will be commissioned in \\n2015-16. \\n\\x0c\\n12 \\n\\n55. Madam Speaker, I hope to garner some additional resources during the \\nyear from tax buoyancy. If I am successful, then over and above the budgetary \\nallocation, I will endeavour to enhance allocations to MGNREGA by ` 5,000 \\ncrore; Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) by `1,500 crore; Integrated \\nChild Protection Scheme (ICPS) by ` 500 crore; and the Prdhan Mantri Krishi \\nSinchai Yojana by ` 3,000 crore; and the initial inflow of ` 5,000 crore into the \\nNIIF. \\nFinancial Markets \\n\\n56. One vital factor in promoting investment in India, including in the \\ninfrastructure sector, is the deepening of the Indian Bond market, which we have \\nto bring at the same level as our world class equity market. I intend to begin this \\nprocess this year by setting up a Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) \\nwhich will bring both India’s external borrowings and domestic debt under one \\nroof. \\n57. I also propose to merge the Forwards Markets Commission with SEBI to \\nstrengthen regulation of commodity forward markets and reduce wild speculation. \\nEnabling legislation, amending the Government Securities Act and the RBI Act \\nis proposed in the Finance Bill, 2015. \\n58. Capital Account Controls is a policy, rather than a regulatory, matter. \\nI, therefore, propose to amend, through the Finance Bill, Section-6 of FEMA to \\nclearly provide that control on capital flows as equity will be exercised by the \\nGovernment, in consultation with the RBI. \\n59. A properly functioning capital market also requires proper consumer \\nprotection. I, therefore, also propose to create a Task Force to establish a sector-\\nneutral Financial Redressal Agency that will address grievances against all \\nfinancial service providers. I am also glad to inform the House that work assigned \\nto the Task Forces on the Financial Data Management Centre, the Financial \\nSector Appellate Tribunal, the Resolution Corporation, and the Public Debt \\nManagement Agency are progressing satisfactorily. We have also received a \\nlarge number of suggestions regarding the Indian Financial Code (IFC), which \\nare currently being reviewed by the Justice Srikrishna Committee. I hope, sooner \\nrather than later, to introduce the IFC in Parliament for consideration. \\n60. Madam, Speaker, this is just the beginning. I have a vision of putting in \\nplace a direct tax regime which is internationally competitive on rates, is without \\nexemptions, incentivises savings, and does not realize tax from intermediaries. \\nSuch a direct tax regime would match the modernized indirect taxes regime we \\nare putting in place by way of GST, and will bring both greater transparency and \\ngreater investments. \\n\\x0c\\n13 \\n\\n61. Madam Speaker the situation with regard to the dormant Employees \\nProvident Fund (EPF) accounts and the claim ratios of ESIs is too well known to \\nbe repeated here. It has been remarked that both EPF and ESI have hostages, \\nrather than clients. Further, the low paid worker suffers deductions greater than \\nthe better paid workers, in percentage terms. \\n62. With respect to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), the employee needs \\nto be provided two options. Firstly, the employee may opt for EPF or the New \\nPension Scheme (NPS). Secondly, for employees below a certain threshold of \\nmonthly income, contribution to EPF should be optional, without affecting or \\nreducing the employer’s contribution. With respect to ESI, the employee should \\nhave the option of choosing either ESI or a Health Insurance product, recognized \\nby the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA). We intend to bring \\namending legislation in this regard, after stakeholder consultation. \\nMonetising Gold \\n\\n63. India is one of the largest consumers of gold in the world and imports as \\nmuch as 800-1000 tonnes of gold each year. Though stocks of gold in India are \\nestimated to be over 20,000 tonnes, mostly this gold is neither traded, nor \\nmonetized. I propose to: \\n(i) Introduce a Gold Monetisation Scheme, which will replace both \\nthe present Gold Deposit and Gold metal Loan Schemes. The new \\nscheme will allow the depositors of gold to earn interest in their \\nmetal accounts and the jewelers to obtain loans in their metal \\naccount. Banks/other dealers would also be able to monetize this \\ngold. \\n(ii) Also develop an alternate financial asset, a Sovereign Gold Bond, \\nas an alternative to purchasing metal gold. The Bonds will carry a \\nfixed rate of interest, and also be redeemable in cash in terms of the \\nface value of the gold, at the time of redemption by the holder of \\nthe Bond. \\n(iii) Commence work on developing an Indian Gold Coin, which will \\ncarry the Ashok Chakra on its face. Such an Indian Gold Coin \\nwould help reduce the demand for coins minted outside India and \\nalso help to recycle the gold available in the country. \\n64. One way to curb the flow of black money is to discourage transactions in \\ncash. Now that a majority of Indians has or can have, a RUPAY debit card. I, \\ntherefore, proposes to introduce soon several measures that will incentivize \\ncredit or debit card transactions, and disincentivise cash transactions. \\n\\x0c\\n14 \\n\\nInvestment \\n\\n65. Alternate Investment Funds Regulations have been notified by SEBI. \\nSuch alternate investment funds provide another vehicle for facilitating domestic \\ninvestments. Keeping in view the need to increase investments from all sources, \\nI propose to also allow foreign investments in Alternate Investment Funds. \\n66. To further simplify the procedures for Indian Companies to attract foreign \\ninvestments, I propose to do away with the distinction between different types of \\nforeign investments, especially between foreign portfolio investments and foreign \\ndirect investments, and replace them with composite caps The sectors which \\nare already on a 100% automatic route would not be affected. \\n67. The ‘Act East’ policy of the Government of India endeavours to cultivate \\nextensive economic and strategic relations in South-East Asia. In order to catalyze \\ninvestments from the Indian private sector in this region, a Project Development \\nCompany will, through separate Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), set up \\nmanufacturing hubs in CMLV countries, namely, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos \\nand Vietnam. \\nSafe India \\n\\n68. My Government is committed to safety and security of women. In order \\nto support programmes for women security, advocacy and awareness, I have \\ndecided to provide another ` 1,000 crore to the Nirbhaya Fund. \\nTourism \\n\\n69. While India has 25 (twenty five) Cultural World Heritage Sites. These \\nfacilities are still deficient and require restoration, including landscape restoration; \\nsignage and interpretation centres; parking; access for the differently abled; \\nvisitors’ amenities, including securities and toilets; illumination and plans for \\nbenefiting communities around them. I propose to provide resources to start \\nwork along these lines for the following Heritage Sites: \\n(i) Churches & Convents of Old Goa \\n(ii) Hampi, Karnataka \\n(iii) Elephanta Caves, Mumbai \\n(iv) Kumbalgarh and other Hill Forts of Rajasthan \\n(v) Rani ki Vav, Patan, Gujarat \\n(vi) Leh Palace, Ladakh, J&K \\n(vii) Varanasi Temple town, UP \\n(viii) Jalianwala bagh, Amritsar, Punjab \\n(ix) Qutub Shahi Tombs, Hyderabad, Telengana \\n\\x0c\\n15 \\n\\n70. After the success of VISAS on arrival issued to travelers of 43 countries, \\nI propose to increase the countries covered to 150, in stages. \\nGreen India \\n\\n71. Madam, as environmental degradation hurts the poor more than others, \\nwe are committed to make our development process as green as possible. Our \\nde facto ‘Carbon Tax’ on most petroleum products compares favourably with \\ninternational norms. With regard to coal, there is a need to find a balance between \\ntaxing pollution, and the price of power. However, beginning this year, I intend \\nto start on that journey too. My Government is also launching a Scheme for \\nFaster Adoption and manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME). I am proposing \\nan initial outlay of `75 crore for this Scheme in 2015-16. The Ministry of New \\nRenewable Energy has revised its target of renewable energy capacity to 1,75,000 \\nMW till 2022, comprising 100,000 MW Solar, 60,000 MW Wind, 10,000 MW \\nBiomass and 5000 MW Small Hydro. \\n72. Madam, Speaker, we are putting the scam, scandal and corruption Raj \\nbehind us. Malfeasance in public procurement can perhaps be contained by \\nhaving a procurement law and an institutional structure consistent with the \\nUNCITRAL model. I believe, Parliament needs to take a view soon on whether \\nwe need a procurement law, and if so, what shape it should take. \\n73. On the other hand, disputes arising in public contracts take long to resolve, \\nand the process is very costly too. My Government proposes to introduce a \\nPublic Contracts (Resolution of Disputes) Bill to streamline the institutional \\narrangements for resolution of such disputes. \\n74. There is also a need, I feel, to tackle the lack of common approach and \\nphilosophy in the regulatory arrangements prevailing even within the different \\nsectors of infrastructure. Our Government, therefore, also proposes to introduce \\na regulatory reform law that will bring about a cogency of approach across various \\nsectors of infrastructure. \\nSkill India \\n\\n75. India is one of the youngest nations in the world with more than 54% of \\nthe total population below 25 years of age. Our young people have to be both \\neducated and employable for the jobs of the 21st Century. The Prime Minister \\nhas explained how Skill India needs to be closely coordinated with Make in \\nIndia. Yet today less than 5% of our potential workforce gets formal skill training \\nto be employable and stay employable. \\n76. We will soon be launching a National Skills Mission through the Skill \\nDevelopment and Entrepreneurship Ministry. The Mission will consolidate skill \\ninitiatives spread across several Ministries and allow us to standardize procedures \\nand outcomes across our 31 Sector Skill Councils. \\n\\x0c\\n16 \\n\\n77. With rural population still forming close to 70% of India’s population, \\nenhancing the employability of rural youth is the key to unlocking India’s \\ndemographic dividend. With this in mind, we had launched the Deen Dayal \\nUpadhyay Gramin Kaushal Yojana. ` 1,500 crore has been set apart for this \\nscheme. Disbursement will be through a digital voucher directly into qualified \\nstudent’s bank account. \\n78. This is the year when we will be entering the 100th birth anniversary of \\nShri Deen Dayalji Upadhyay. The intention of the Government is to celebrate \\nthe anniversary of this great nationalist, in a befitting manner. A 100th Birthday \\nCelebration Committee will be announced soon, and adequate resources provided \\nfor the celebration. \\n79. With a view to enable all poor and middle class students to pursue higher \\neducation of their choice without any constraint of funds, I propose to set up a \\nfully IT based Student Financial Aid Authority to administer and monitor \\nScholarship as well Educational Loan Schemes, through the Pradhan Mantri \\nVidya Lakshmi Karyakram. We will ensure that no student misses out on higher \\neducation for lack of funds. \\n80. Hon’ble Members will remember that in the Budget Speech of July, \\nI had indicated my intention to provide one major Central Institute in each State. \\nIn the fiscal year 2015-16, I propose to set up All India Institutes of Medical \\nSciences in J&K, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh and Assam. Keeping \\nin view the need to augment Medical Sciences in Bihar, I propose to set up \\nanother AIIMS like institution in these States. I propose to set up an IIT in \\nKarnataka, and upgrade Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad into a full-fledged \\nIIT. I also propose to set up a Post Graduate Institute of Horticulture Research \\nand Education in Amritsar. IIMs will be setup in J&K and Andhra Pradesh. In \\nKerala, I propose to upgrade the existing National Institute of Speech and Hearing \\nto a University of Disability Studies and Rehabilitation. I also propose three \\nnew National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research: in \\nMaharashtra, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh; and an Institutes of Science and \\nEducation Research in Nagaland and Odisha. I also propose to set up a Centre \\nfor Film Production, Animation and Gaming in Arunachal Pradesh, for the North-\\nEastern States; and Apprenticeship Training Institute for Women in Haryana and \\nUttrakhand. \\n81. In order to improve the Governance of Public Sector banks, the \\nGovernment intends to set up an autonomous bank Board Bureau. The Bureau \\nwill search and select heads of Public Sector banks and help them in developing \\ndifferentiated strategies and capital raising plans through innovative financial \\nmethods and instruments. This would be an interim step towards establishing a \\nholding and investment Company for Banks. \\n\\x0c\\n17 \\n\\nDigital India \\n\\n82. Madam, Speaker, I would like to inform the House we are making good \\nprogress towards making Digital India. The National Optical Fibre Network \\nProgramme (NOFNP) of 7.5 lakh kms. networking 2.5 lakh villages is being \\nfurther speeded up by allowing willing States to undertake its execution, on \\nreimbursement of cost as determined by Department of Telecommunications. \\nAndhra Pradesh is the first State to have opted for this manner of implementation. \\n83. As Members are aware, in making their recommendations, the Finance \\nCommission has not distinguished between special category and other states. \\nMoreover, both Bihar and West Bengal are going to be amongst the biggest \\nbeneficiaries of the recommendations of the Finance Commission. Yet, the Eastern \\nStates have to be given an opportunity to grow even faster. I, therefore, propose \\nto give similar special assistance to Bihar and West Bengal as has been provided \\nby the Government of India in the case of Government of Andhra Pradesh. As \\nregards Andhra Pradesh and Telengana, the Government is committed to comply \\nwith all the legal commitments made to these States at the time of reorganization. \\n84. In spite of the large increase in devolution to states, which implies reduced \\nfiscal space for the Centre in the same proportion we are committed to the welfare \\nof the poor and the neo-middle class. Keeping this in mind, adequate provision \\nis being made for the schemes for the poor and the dis-advantaged. Illustratively, \\nI have allocated `68,968 crore to the education sector including mid-day meals, \\n` 33,152 crore to the health sector and ` 79,526 crore for rural development \\nactivities including MGNREGA, ` 22,407 crore for housing and urban \\ndevelopment, ` 10,351 crore for women and child development, ` 4,173 crore \\nfor Water Resources and Namami Gange. The significant sums that will be spent \\nby the States on these programmes will ensure a quantum leap in expenditures in \\nthese areas. I urge states to utilize their enhanced resources effectively in these \\nareas. \\n85. Madam, Speaker, I am delighted to report good progress for DMIC \\ncorridors: the Ahmedabad-Dhaulera Investment Region in Gujarat, and the \\nShendra–Bidkin Industrial Park near Aurangabad, in Maharashtra, are now in a \\nposition to start work on basic infrastructure. In the current year, I have earmarked \\nan initial sum of ` 1,200 crore. However, as the pace of expenditure picks up, I \\nwill provide them additional funds. \\n86. Defence of every square inch of our mother land comes before anything \\nelse. So far, we have been over dependent on imports, with its attendant \\nunwelcome spin-offs. Our Government has already permitted FDI in defence so \\nthat the Indian-controlled entities also become manufacturers of defence \\nequipments, not only for us, but for export. We are thus pursuing the Make in \\nIndia policy to achieve greater self-sufficiency in the area of defence equipment, \\n\\x0c\\n18 \\n\\nincluding aircraft. Members of this august House would have noted that we \\nhave been both transparent and quick in making defence equipment related \\npurchase decisions, thus keeping our defence forces ready for any eventuality. \\nThis year too, I have provided adequately for the needs of the armed forces. As \\nagainst likely expenditure of this year of ` 2,22,370 crore the budget allocation \\nfor 2015-16 is ` 2,46,727 crore. \\n\\n87. While India produces some of the finest financial minds, including in \\ninternational finance, they have few avenues in India to fully exhibit and exploit \\ntheir strength to the country’s advantage. GIFT in Gujarat was envisaged as \\nInternational Finance Centre that would actually become as good an International \\nFinance Centre as Singapore or Dubai, which, incidentally, are largely manned \\nby Indians. The proposal has languished for years. I am glad to announce that \\nthe first phase of GIFT will soon become a reality. Appropriate regulations will \\nbe issued in March. \\n88. For the quick resolution of commercial disputes, the Government proposes \\nto set up exclusive commercial divisions in various courts in India based on the \\nrecommendations of the 253rd Report of the Law Commission. The Government \\nproposes to introduce a Bill in the parliament after consulting stakeholders in \\nthis regard. \\n89. Madam Speaker, the Government will, during this session, also place \\nbefore the Parliament the required Bills, to convert Ordinances issued by the \\nGovernment into Acts of Parliament. \\nBUDGET ESTIMATES \\n\\n90. I now turn to the Budget Estimates for Budget 2015-16. \\n91. Non-Plan expenditure estimates for the Financial Year are estimated at \\n`13,12,200 crore. Plan expenditure is estimated to be `4,65,277 crore, which is \\nvery near to the R.E. of 2014-15. Total Expenditure has accordingly been \\nestimated at ` 17,77,477 crore. The requirements for expenditure on Defence, \\nInternal Security and other necessary expenditures are adequately provided. \\n92. Gross Tax receipts are estimated to be ` 14,49,490 crore. Devolution to \\nthe States is estimated to be `5,23,958 crore. Share of Central Government will \\nbe ` 9,19,842 crore. Non Tax Revenues for the next fiscal are estimated to be \\n`2,21,733 crore. \\n93. With the above estimates, fiscal deficit will be 3.9 per cent of GDP and \\nRevenue Deficit will be 2.8 per cent of GDP. \\n\\x0c\\n19 \\n\\nPART B \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\n94. I now turn to my tax proposals. \\n95. Taxation is an instrument of social and economic engineering. Tax \\ncollections help the Government to provide education, healthcare, housing and \\nother basic facilities to the people to improve their quality of life and to address \\nthe problems of poverty, unemployment and slow development. To achieve \\nthese objectives, it has been our endeavour in the last nine months to foster a \\nstable taxation policy and non-adversarial tax administration. A very important \\ndimension to our tax administration is the fight against the scourge of black \\nmoney. A number of measures have already been taken in this direction. \\nI propose to do much more. \\n96. We need to revive growth and investment to ensure that more jobs are \\ncreated for our youth and benefits of development reach millions of our poor. \\nWe need an enabling tax policy for this. I have already introduced the Bill to \\namend the Constitution of India for Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the last \\nSession of this august House. GST is expected to play a transformative role in \\nthe way our economy functions. It will add buoyancy to our economy by \\ndeveloping a common Indian market and reducing the cascading effect on the \\ncost of goods and services. We are moving in various fronts to implement GST \\nfrom the next year. \\n97. We need to match this transformative piece of legislation in indirect \\ntaxation with transformative measures in direct taxation. The basic rate of \\nCorporate Tax in India at 30% is higher than the rates prevalent in the other \\nmajor Asian economies, making our domestic industry uncompetitive. Moreover, \\nthe effective collection of Corporate Tax is about 23%. We lose out on both \\ncounts, i.e. we are considered as having a high Corporate Tax regime but we do \\nnot get that tax due to excessive exemptions. A regime of exemptions has led to \\npressure groups, litigation and loss of revenue. It also gives room for avoidable \\ndiscretion. I, therefore, propose to reduce the rate of Corporate Tax from 30% to \\n25% over the next 4 years. This will lead to higher level of investment, higher \\ngrowth and more jobs. This process of reduction has to be necessarily \\naccompanied by rationalisation and removal of various kinds of tax exemptions \\nand incentives for corporate taxpayers, which incidentally account for a large \\nnumber of tax disputes. \\n98. I wanted to start the phased reduction of corporate tax rate and phased \\nelimination of exemptions right away; but I thought it would be appropriate to \\ngive advance notice that these changes will start from the next financial year. \\n\\x0c\\n20 \\n\\nOur stated policy is to avoid sudden surprises and instability in tax policy. \\nExemptions to individual taxpayers will, however, continue since they facilitate \\nsavings which get transferred to investment and economic growth. \\n\\n99. While finalising my tax proposals, I have adopted certain broad themes, \\nwhich include: \\nA. Measures to curb black money; \\nB. Job creation through revival of growth and investment and promotion \\nof domestic manufacturing and ‘Make in India’; \\nC. Minimum government and maximum governance to improve the \\nease of doing business; \\nD. Benefits to middle class taxpayers; \\nE. Improving the quality of life and public health through Swachch \\nBharat initiatives; and \\nF. Stand alone proposals to maximise benefits to the economy. \\n100. Madam Speaker, the first and foremost pillar of my tax proposals is to \\neffectively deal with the problem of black money which eats into the vitals of \\nour economy and society. The problems of poverty and inequity cannot be \\neliminated unless generation of black money and its concealment is dealt with \\neffectively and forcefully. \\n101. In the last 9 months several measures have been initiated in this direction. \\nA major breakthrough was achieved in October, 2014 when a delegation from \\nthe Revenue Department visited Switzerland and the Swiss authorities agreed to \\n(a) provide information in respect of cases independently investigated by the \\nIncome-tax Department; (b) confirm genuineness of bank accounts and provide \\nnon-banking information; (c) provide such information in a time bound manner; \\nand (d) commence talks with India for Automatic Exchange of Information \\nbetween the two countries at the earliest. Investigation into cases of undisclosed \\nforeign assets has been accorded the highest priority, resulting in detection of \\nsubstantial amounts of unreported income. For strengthening collection of \\ninformation from various sources domestically, a new structure is being put in \\nplace which includes electronic filing of statements by reporting entities. This \\nwill ensure seamless integration of data and more effective enforcement. \\n102. Tracking down and bringing back the wealth which legitimately belongs \\nto the country is our abiding commitment to the country. Recognising the \\nlimitations under the existing legislation, we have taken a considered decision \\nto enact a comprehensive new law on black money to specifically deal with such \\nmoney stashed away abroad. To this end, I propose to introduce a Bill in the \\ncurrent Session of the Parliament. \\n\\x0c\\n21 \\n\\n103. With your permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to highlight some \\nof the key features of the proposed new law on black money. \\n(1) Concealment of income and assets and evasion of tax in relation to \\nforeign assets will be prosecutable with punishment of rigorous \\nimprisonment upto 10 years. Further, \\n• \\nthis offence will be made non-compoundable; \\n• \\nthe offenders will not be permitted to approach the Settlement \\nCommission; and \\n• \\npenalty for such concealment of income and assets at the rate of \\n300% of tax shall be levied. \\n(2) Non filing of return or filing of return with inadequate disclosure of \\nforeign assets will be liable for prosecution with punishment of \\nrigorous imprisonment up to 7 years. \\n(3) Income in relation to any undisclosed foreign asset or undisclosed \\nincome from any foreign asset will be taxable at the maximum \\nmarginal rate. Exemptions or deductions which may otherwise be \\napplicable in such cases, shall not be allowed. \\n(4) Beneficial owner or beneficiary of foreign assets will be mandatorily \\nrequired to file return, even if there is no taxable income. \\n(5) Abettors of the above offences, whether individuals, entities, banks \\nor financial institutions will be liable for prosecution and penalty. \\n(6) Date of Opening of foreign account would be mandatorily required \\nto be specified by the assessee in the return of income. \\n(7) The offence of concealment of income or evasion of tax in relation \\nto a foreign asset will be made a predicate offence under the \\nPrevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). This provision \\nwould enable the enforcement agencies to attach and confiscate \\nunaccounted assets held abroad and launch prosecution against \\npersons indulging in laundering of black money. \\n(8) The definition of ‘proceeds of crime’ under PMLA is being amended \\nto enable attachment and confiscation of equivalent asset in India \\nwhere the asset located abroad cannot be forfeited. \\n(9) The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) is also being \\namended to the effect that if any foreign exchange, foreign security \\nor any immovable property situated outside India is held in \\ncontravention of the provisions of this Act, then action may be taken \\n\\x0c\\n22 \\n\\nfor seizure and eventual confiscation of assets of equivalent value \\nsituated in India. These contraventions are also being made liable \\nfor levy of penalty and prosecution with punishment of imprisonment \\nup to five years. \\n\\n104. As regards curbing domestic black money, a new and more comprehensive \\nBenami Transactions (Prohibition) Bill will be introduced in the current session \\nof the Parliament. This law will enable confiscation of benami property and \\nprovide for prosecution, thus blocking a major avenue for generation and holding \\nof black money in the form of benami property, especially in real estate. \\n105. A few other measures are also proposed in the Budget for curbing black \\nmoney within the country. The Finance Bill includes a proposal to amend the \\nIncome-tax Act to prohibit acceptance or payment of an advance of `20,000 or \\nmore in cash for purchase of immovable property. Quoting of PAN is being \\nmade mandatory for any purchase or sale exceeding the value of `1 lakh. The \\nthird party reporting entities would be required to furnish information about \\nforeign currency sales and cross border transactions. Provision is also being \\nmade to tackle splitting of reportable transactions. To improve enforcement, \\nCBDT and CBEC will leverage technology and have access to information in \\neach other’s database. \\n106. Madam Speaker, the second pillar of my taxation proposals this year is \\njob creation through revival of growth and investment and promotion of domestic \\nmanufacturing and ‘Make in India’. I propose to undertake a series of steps in \\nthis direction to attract capital, both domestic and foreign. Tax ‘pass through’is \\nproposed to be allowed to both Category-I and Category-II Alternative Investment \\nFunds, so that tax is levied on the investors in these Funds and not on the Funds \\nper se. This will step up the ability of these Funds to mobilise higher resources \\nand make higher investments in small and medium enterprises, infrastructure \\nand social projects and provide the much required private equity to new ventures \\nand start-ups. \\n107. A step was taken in the last Budget to encourage Real Estate Investment \\nTrusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investments Trusts (InvITs) by providing partial \\npass through to them. These collective investment vehicles have an important \\nrole to revive construction activity. A large quantum of funds is locked up in \\nvarious completed projects which need to be released to facilitate new \\ninfrastructure projects to take off. I therefore propose to rationalise the capital \\ngains regime for the sponsors exiting at the time of listing of the units of REITs \\nand InvITs, subject to payment of Securities Transaction Tax (STT). The rental \\nincome of REITs from their own assets will have pass through facility. \\n\\x0c\\n23 \\n\\n108. The present taxation structure has an inbuilt incentive for fund managers \\nto operate from offshore locations. To encourage such offshore fund managers \\nto relocate to India, I propose to modify the Permanent Establishment (PE) norms \\nto the effect that mere presence of a fund manager in India would not constitute \\nPE of the offshore funds resulting in adverse tax consequences. \\n109. Implementation of the General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) has been a \\nmatter of public debate. The investment sentiment in the country has now turned \\npositive and we need to accelerate this momentum. There are also certain \\ncontentious issues relating to GAAR which need to be resolved. It has therefore \\nbeen decided to defer the applicability of GAAR by two years. Further, it has \\nalso been decided that when implemented, GAAR would apply prospectively to \\ninvestments made on or after 01.04.2017. \\n110. Today I see a lot of young entrepreneurs running business ventures or \\nwanting to start new ones. They need latest technology. Therefore, to facilitate \\ntechnology inflow to small businesses at low costs, I propose to reduce the rate \\nof income tax on royalty and fees for technical services from 25% to 10%. \\n111. To generate greater employment opportunities, it is proposed to extend \\nthe benefit of deduction for employment of new regular workmen to all business \\nentities. The eligibility threshold of minimum 100 regular workmen is being \\nreduced to fifty. \\n112. The role of indirect taxes is also very important in the context of promotion \\nof domestic manufacturing and Make in India. In indirect taxes, therefore, I \\npropose to reduce the rates of basic customs duty on certain inputs, raw materials, \\nintermediates and components (in all 22 items) so as to minimise the impact of \\nduty inversion and reduce the manufacturing cost in several sectors. Some \\nother changes address the problem of CENVAT credit accumulation due to the \\nlevy of SAD. I propose to fully exempt all goods, except populated printed \\ncircuit boards for use in manufacture of ITA bound items from SAD and reduce \\nthe SAD on imports of certain other inputs and raw materials subject to actual \\nuser condition. These changes are detailed in the Annexure to the Budget Speech. \\n113. My next proposal is regarding minimum government and maximum \\ngovernance with focus on ease of doing business and simplification of Tax \\nProcedures without compromising on tax revenues. The total wealth tax collection \\nin the country was `1,008 crore in 2013-14. Should a tax which leads to high \\ncost of collection and a low yield be continued or should it be replaced with a \\nlow cost and higher yield tax? The rich and wealthy must pay more tax than the \\nless affluent ones. I have therefore decided to abolish the wealth tax and replace \\nit with an additional surcharge of 2% on the super-rich with a taxable income of \\nover `1 crore. This will lead to tax simplification and enable the Department to \\n\\x0c\\n24 \\n\\nfocus more on ensuring tax compliance and widening the tax base. As against a \\ntax sacrifice of `1,008 crore, through these measures the Department would be \\ncollecting about `9,000 crore from the 2% additional surcharge. Further, to \\ntrack the wealth held by individuals and entities, the information regarding the \\nassets which are currently required to be furnished in wealth-tax return will be \\ncaptured in the income tax returns. This will ensure that the abolition of wealth \\ntax does not lead to escape of any income from the tax net. \\n\\n114. The provision relating to indirect transfers in the Income-tax Act which \\nis a legacy from the previous government contains several ambiguities. This \\nprovision is being suitably cleaned up. Further, concerns regarding applicability \\nof indirect transfer provisions to dividends paid by foreign companies to their \\nshareholders will be addressed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes through a \\nclarificatory circular. These changes would eliminate the scope for discretionary \\nexercise of power and provide a hassle free structure to the taxpayers. I reiterate \\nwhat I had said in the last Budget that ordinarily retrospective tax provisions \\nadversely impact the stability and predictability of the taxation regime and resort \\nto such provisions shall be avoided. \\n115. Further, to reduce the associated hassles to smaller taxpayers and the \\ncompliance costs in domestic transfer pricing, I propose to increase the threshold \\nlimit from `5 crore to `20 crore. \\n116. In order to rationalise the MAT provisions for FIIs, profits corresponding \\nto their income from capital gains on transactions in securities which are liable \\nto tax at a lower rate, shall not be subject to MAT. \\n117. The Tax Administration Reform Commission (TARC) has given a number \\nof recommendations to improve the administration in the Tax Departments. These \\nrecommendations are in advanced stage of examination and will be appropriately \\nimplemented during the course of this year. \\n118. As part of the movement towards GST, I propose to subsume the \\nEducation Cess and the Secondary and Higher Education Cess in Central Excise \\nduty. In effect, the general rate of Central Excise Duty of 12.36% including the \\ncesses is being rounded off to 12.5%. I also propose to revise the specific rates \\nof Central Excise duty in certain other commodities, as detailed in the Annexure. \\nHowever, in the case of petrol and diesel such specific rates are being revised \\nonly to the extent of subsuming the quantum of education cess presently levied \\non them, keeping the total incidence of excise duties unchanged. The ad-valorem \\nrates of excise duty lower than 12% and those higher than 12% with a few \\nexceptions are not being increased. Some changes are also being made to excise \\nlevy on cigarettes and the compounded levy scheme applicable to pan masala, \\ngutkha and certain other tobacco products. \\n\\x0c\\n25 \\n\\n119. To give a boost to domestic leather footwear industry, the excise duty on \\nfootwear with leather uppers and having retail price of more than `1000 per pair \\nis being reduced to 6%. \\n120. To further facilitate the ease of doing business, online central excise and \\nservice tax registration will be done in two working days. The assessees under \\nthese taxes will be allowed to issue digitally signed invoices and maintain \\nelectronic records. These measures will cut down lot of paper work and red \\ntape. Time limit for taking CENVAT credit on inputs and input services is being \\nincreased from six months to one year as a measure of business facilitation. \\n121. Introduction of GST is eagerly awaited by Trade and Industry. To facilitate \\na smooth transition to levy of tax on services by both the Centre and the States, \\nit is proposed to increase the present rate of service tax plus education cesses \\nfrom 12.36% to a consolidated rate of 14%. \\n122. Madam Speaker, cleanliness of households and clean environment are \\nvery important social causes. The fourth pillar of my taxation proposals this \\nyear therefore relates to initiatives for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. In my direct \\ntax proposals, I have proposed 100% deduction for contributions, other than by \\nway of CSR contributions, to the Swachh Bharat Kosh. A similar tax treatment \\nis also proposed for the Clean Ganga Fund. \\n123. In indirect taxes, I propose to increase the Clean Energy Cess from `100 \\nto `200 per metric tonne of coal, etc. to finance clean environment initiatives. \\nExcise duty on sacks and bags of polymers of ethylene other than for industrial \\nuse is being increased from 12% to 15%. It is also proposed to have an enabling \\nprovision to levy Swachh Bharat Cess at a rate of 2% or less on all or certain \\nservices if need arises. This Cess will be effective from a date to be notified. \\nResources generated from this cess will be utilised for financing and promoting \\ninitiatives towards Swachh Bharat. \\n124. It is also proposed to exempt services by common affluent treatment \\nplants from service tax. The concessions from customs and excise duties currently \\navailable on specified parts for manufacture of electrically operated vehicles \\nand hybrid vehicles are being extended by one more year i.e. up to 31.3.2016. \\n125. Madam Speaker, the fifth pillar of my taxation proposals this year is \\nextension of benefits to middle class tax payers. The proposals in this regard are \\nas follows : \\n• \\nIncrease in the limit of deduction in respect of health insurance \\npremium from `15,000 to `25,000. \\no \\nFor senior citizens the limit will stand increased to `30,000 from \\nthe existing `20,000. \\n\\x0c\\n26 \\n\\no \\nFor very senior citizens of the age of 80 years or more, who are \\nnot covered by health insurance, deduction of ` 30,000 towards \\nexpenditure incurred on their treatment will be allowed. \\n• \\nThe deduction limit of ` 60,000 towards expenditure on account of \\nspecified diseases of serious nature is proposed to be enhanced to \\n`80,000 in case of very senior citizens. \\n• \\nAdditional deduction of ` 25,000 will be allowed for differently abled \\npersons under Section 80DD and Section 80U of the Income-tax \\nAct. \\n• \\nThe limit on deduction on account of contribution to a Pension Fund \\nand the New Pension Scheme is proposed to be increased from \\n`1 lakh to `1.5 lakh. \\n• \\nTo provide social safety net and the facility of pension to individuals, \\nan additional deduction of ` 50,000 is proposed to be provided for \\ncontribution to the New Pension Scheme under Section 80CCD. \\nThis will enable India to become a pensioned society instead of a \\npensionless society. \\n• \\nInvestments in Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme is already eligible for \\ndeduction under Section 80C. All payments to the beneficiaries \\nincluding interest payment on deposit will also be fully exempt. \\n• \\nTransport allowance exemption is being increased from `800 to \\n`1,600 per month. \\n• \\nFor the benefit of senior citizens, service tax exemption will be \\nprovided on Varishta Bima Yojana. \\n126. Madam Speaker, I am giving these concessions to individual taxpayers \\ndespite inadequate fiscal space. After taking into account the tax concession \\ngiven to middle class tax payers in my last Budget and this Budget, today an \\nindividual tax payer will get tax benefit of `4,44,200 as detailed in the annexure. \\nAs and when my fiscal capacity improves, individual taxpayers will have a lot to \\nlook forward to. \\n127. Madam Speaker, there are several stand-alone proposals relating to \\ntaxation. These include conversion of existing excise duty on petrol and diesel \\nto the extent of `4 per litre into Road Cess to fund investment in roads and other \\ninfrastructure. An additional sum of ` 40,000 crore will be made available through \\nthis measure for these sectors. In service tax, exemption is being extended to \\ncertain pre cold storage services in relation to fruits and vegetables so as to \\n\\x0c\\n27 \\n\\nincentivise value addition in this crucial sector. The Negative List under service \\ntax is being slightly pruned and certain other exemptions are being withdrawn to \\nwiden the tax base. \\n\\n128. Yoga is India’s well acknowledged gift to the world. It is proposed to \\ninclude yoga within the ambit of charitable purpose under Section 2(15) of the \\nIncome-tax Act. Further, to mitigate the problem being faced by many genuine \\ncharitable institutions, it is proposed to modify the ceiling on receipts from \\nactivities in the nature of trade, commerce or business to 20% of the total receipts \\nfrom the existing ceiling of `25 lakh. A national database of non profit \\norganisations is also being developed. \\n129. Enactment of a Direct Taxes Code (DTC) has been under discussion for \\nquite some time. Most of the provisions of the DTC have already been included \\nin the Income-tax Act. Among the very few aspects of DTC which were left out, \\nwe have addressed some of the issues in the present Budget. Further, the \\njurisprudence under the Income-tax Act is well evolved. Considering all these \\naspects, there is no great merit in going ahead with the Direct Tax Code as it \\nexists today. \\n130. Madam Speaker, the details of direct and indirect tax proposals are given \\nin the Annexure to the Budget speech and the other budget documents laid on \\nthe Table of the House. My direct tax proposals would result in revenue loss of \\n`8,315 crore, whereas the proposals in indirect taxes are expected to yield `23,383 \\ncrore. Thus, the net impact of all tax proposals would be revenue gain of `15,068 \\ncrore. \\nCONCLUSION \\n\\n131. To conclude, Madam Speaker, it is no secret that expectations of this \\nBudget have been high. People who urge us to undertake Big Bang Reforms, \\nalso say that the Indian economy is a giant super tanker, or an elephant. An \\nelephant, Madam Speaker, moves slowly but surely. Even our worst critics would \\nadmit that we have moved rapidly. In this speech, I think I have clearly outlined \\nnot only what we are going to do immediately, but also a roadmap for the future. \\n132. I think I can genuinely stake, for our Government, a claim of intellectual \\nhonesty. We have been consistent in what we have said, and what we are doing. \\nWe are committed, Madam Speaker, to achieving what we have been voted to \\npower for: Change, growth, jobs and genuine, effective upliftment of the poor \\nand the under-privileged. Our commitment to the ‘Daridra Narayan’ is steadfast, \\nas is commitment to the Constitutional principles of Equality and Justice for All, \\n\\x0c\\n28 \\n\\nwithout concern for caste, creed or religion.

Changes in the Finance Act, 1994 \\n1. A definition of the term “government” is being incorporated in \\nthe Act to resolve interpretational issues as regards the scope \\nof this term in the context of the Negative List and service tax \\nexemptions. \\n2. To amend the definition of term “service” to specifically state \\nthe intention of legislature to levy service tax on: \\ni. chit fund foremen by way of conducting a chit; and \\nii. distributor or selling agent of lottery, as appointed or \\nauthorized by the organizing state for promoting, marketing, \\ndistributing, selling, or assisting the state in any other way \\nfor organizing and conducting a lottery. \\n3. It is being specifically prescribed in the Act that value of a \\ntaxable service shall include any reimbursable cost or \\nexpenditure incurred and charged by the service provider to \\nmake legal position clear and avoid disputes. \\n4. Section 66F of the Act prescribes that unless otherwise \\nspecified, reference to a service shall not include reference to \\nany input service used for providing such service. An illustration \\nis being incorporated in this section to exemplify the scope of \\nthis provision. \\n2. Rationalization of abatement \\n1. A uniform abatement is being prescribed for transport by \\nrail, road and vessel to bring parity in these sectors. Service \\nTax shall be payable on 30% of the value of such service \\n\\x0c\\n46 \\n\\nsubject to a uniform condition of non-availment of Cenvat \\nCredit on inputs, capital goods and input services. Presently, \\ntax is payable on 30% of the value in case of rail transport, \\n25% in case of road transport and 40% in case of transport \\nby vessels. \\n\\n2. The abatement for executive (business/first class) air travel, \\nwherein the service element is higher, is being reduced from \\n60% to 40%. Consequently, service tax would be payable \\non 60% of the value of fare for business class. \\n3. Abatement is being withdrawn on chit fund service. \\n3. Service Tax Rules \\n1. In respect of any service provided under aggregator model, \\nthe aggregator is being made liable to pay service tax if the \\nservice is provided using the brand name of aggregator in \\nany manner. \\n2. Consequent to the upward revision in Service Tax rate, the \\ncomposition rate on specified services, namely, life insurance \\nservice, services of air travel agent, money changing service \\nprovided by banks or authorized dealers, and service \\nprovided by lottery distributor and selling agent, is proposed \\nto be revised proportionately. \\n4. Reverse charge mechanism \\n1. Manpower supply and security services when provided by \\nindividual, HUF, partnership firm to a body corporate are \\nbeing brought to full reverse charge as a simplification \\nmeasure. Presently, these are taxed under partial reverse \\ncharge mechanism. \\n2. Services provided by mutual fund agents, mutual fund \\ndistributors and lottery agents are being brought to under \\nreverse charge consequent to withdrawal of exemption on \\nsuch services. \\n5. The Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 \\nCenvat Credit Rules are being amended to allow credit of \\nservice tax paid under partial reverse charge by the service \\nreceiver without linking it to the payments of value of service \\nto service provider as a trade facilitation measure.', \"CONTENTS \\n\\nPART -A \\n\\nPage No. \\n\\nIntroduction 1 \\nAgriculture and Farmers' Welfare 4 \\nRural Sector 7 \\nSocial Sector including Health Care 9 \\nEducation, Skills and Job Creation 11 \\nInfrastructure and Investment 13 \\nFinancial Sector Reforms 17 \\nGovernance and Ease of Doing Business 19 \\nFiscal Discipline 20 \\n\\nPART -B \\n\\nTAX REFORMS \\nRelief to small tax payers 23 \\nMeasures to boost growth and employment \\ngeneration \\n24 \\nIncentivising \\ndomestic value addition \\nto help \\nMake in India \\n26 \\nMeasures for moving towards a \\npensioned society \\n26 \\nMeasures for \\npromoting affordable housing \\n27 \\nAdditional resource \\nmobilization for agriculture, \\nrural economy and clean environment \\n27 \\nReducing litigation and providing certainty \\nin taxation \\n29 \\nSimplification and rationalization of taxation \\n31 \\nUse of Technology for creating accountability \\n32 \\nConclusion \\n33 \\nAnnexes \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n(ii) ii) \\n\\nAnnexes \\nto Part \\n–A \\nAnnex-I : \\nProposed Changes/Reforms \\n\\n\\nin FDI and \\nRelated Policies \\n34 \\nAnnex-II : \\nMeasures for Deepening \\n\\n\\nof Corporate Bond Market \\n35 \\nAnnex-III-A : \\nAllocations of Important \\n\\n\\nMinistries, Sectors and Vulnerable \\n\\n\\nSections \\n36 \\nAnnex-III-B : \\nAllocations of Important \\n\\n\\nSchemes \\n37 \\nAnnex-III-C \\n: \\nResources Transferred to \\n\\n\\nState and \\nU.T.

I am presenting this Budget when the global economy is in serious \\ncrisis. Global growth has slowed down from 3.4% in 2014 to 3.1% in 2015. \\nFinancial markets have been battered and global trade has contracted. \\nAmidst all these global headwinds, the Indian economy has held its ground \\nfirmly. Thanks to our inherent strengths and the policies of this Government, \\na lot of confidence and hope continues to be built around India. \\n3. The International Monetary Fund has hailed India as a ‘bright spot’ \\namidst a slowing global economy. The World Economic Forum has said that \\nIndia’s growth is ‘extraordinarily high’. We accomplished this despite very \\nunfavourable conditions and despite the fact that we inherited an economy of \\nlow growth, high inflation and zero investor confidence in Government’s \\n\\ncapability to govern. We converted these difficulties and challenges into \\nopportunities. \\n\\nBÉE¶iÉÉÒ SÉãÉÉxÉä ´ÉÉãÉÉå xÉä \\nVÉ¤É cÉ® BÉäE nÉÒ {ÉiÉ´ÉÉ® càÉå \\nãÉc®-ãÉc® iÉÚ}ÉEÉxÉ ÉÊàÉãÉä +ÉÉè® \\nàÉÉèVÉ-àÉÉèVÉ àÉÄZÉnÉ® càÉå \\nÉÊ{ÉE® £ÉÉÒ ÉÊnJÉÉªÉÉ cè càÉxÉä +ÉÉè® ÉÊ{ÉE® ªÉä ÉÊnJÉÉ nåMÉä ºÉ¤ÉBÉEÉä \\n<xÉ cÉãÉÉiÉ àÉå \\n+ÉÉiÉÉ \\ncè nÉÊ®ªÉÉ BÉE®xÉÉ {ÉÉ® càÉå \\n\\n\\n4. Let us look at our achievements compared to the last three years of \\nthe previous Government when growth had decelerated to 6.3%. The growth \\nof GDP has now accelerated to 7.6%. This was possible notwithstanding the \\ncontraction of global exports by 4.4% compared to 7.7% growth in world \\nexports during the last three years of the previous Government. CPI inflation \\nwas at 9.4% during the last three years of the previous Government. Under \\nour Government, CPI inflation has come down to 5.4%, providing big relief \\nto the public. This was accomplished despite two consecutive years of \\nmonsoon shortfall of 13%, compared to normal rainfall in the last three years \\nof the previous Government. \\n\\x0c\\n2 \\n\\n5. Our external situation is robust. The Current Account deficit has \\ndeclined from 18.4 billion US dollars in the first half of last year to 14.4 \\nbillion this year. It is projected to be 1.4% of GDP at the end of this year. \\nOur foreign exchange reserves are at the highest ever level of about 350 \\nbillion US dollars. \\n6. Our initiatives in the last 21 months have not only placed the \\neconomy on a faster growth trajectory but have bridged the trust deficit, \\ncreated by the previous Government. We had to work in an unsupportive \\nglobal environment, adverse weather conditions and an obstructive political \\natmosphere. \\nàÉèbàÉ, càÉå +ÉÉºÉàÉÉxÉÉÒ \\n+ÉÉè® \\nºÉÖãiÉÉxÉÉÒ nÉäxÉÉå {ÉÉÊ®¤ÉãÉÉå xÉä {É®ä¶ÉÉxÉ ÉÊBÉEªÉÉ cè* \\n\\n\\n7. We believe in the principle that money with the Government belongs \\nto the people and we have the sacred responsibility to spend it prudently and \\nwisely for the welfare of our people, especially the poor and the \\ndowntrodden. We have increased our Plan expenditure at the RE stage in \\n2015-16 in contrast to the usual practice of reducing it. We achieved this \\ndespite adopting the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations \\nwhich increased devolution to the States by 55%. \\n8. We must now look ahead. The risks of further global slowdown and \\nturbulence are mounting. This complicates the task of economic \\nmanagement for India. It has three serious implications for us. First, we \\nmust strengthen our firewalls against these risks by ensuring macroeconomic \\nstability and prudent fiscal management. Second, since foreign \\nmarkets are weak, we must rely on domestic demand and Indian markets to \\nensure that India’s growth does not slow down. And third, we must continue \\nwith the pace of economic reforms and policy initiatives to change the lives \\nof our people for the better. \\n9. We see these challenges as opportunities. The financial years \\n2015-16 and 2016-17 have been and will be extremely challenging for \\nGovernment expenditure. The 14th Finance Commission has reduced the \\nCentral share of taxes to 58% from the 68%. In the financial year 2015-16, \\nwe managed to improve upon the budgeted expenditure due to revenue \\nbuoyancy, notwithstanding the steep reduction in the Central share of taxes. \\nThe next financial year 2016-17 will cast an additional burden on account of \\n7th \\n\\nthe recommendations of the Central Pay Commission and the \\nimplementation of Defence OROP. The Government, therefore, has to \\nprioritise its expenditure. We wish to enhance expenditure in the farm and \\nrural sector, the social sector, the infrastructure sector and provide for \\n\\n\\x0c\\n3 \\n\\nrecapitalisation of the banks. This will address those sectors which need \\nimmediate attention. Once the Government discharges these priority \\nobligations, it shall then focus on other areas which are also of utmost \\npriority to the Government. \\n\\n10. While increasing the outlay of various social sector programmes, the \\nGovernment will undertake three major schemes to help the weaker sections \\nof the society. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has already been \\nannounced to protect the farmer from the adverse consequences of nature. \\nThe farmer will pay a nominal amount of insurance premium and get the \\nhighest ever compensation in the event of any loss suffered. A health \\ninsurance scheme which protects one-third of India’s population against \\nhospitalisation expenditure is also being announced. The Government is \\nalso launching a new initiative to ensure that the BPL families are \\nprovided with a cooking gas connection, supported by a Government \\nsubsidy. This will significantly improve the health of women and those BPL \\nfamilies who suffer adversely from the ill-effects of Chulha cooking. \\n11. The Annual Budget is also an opportunity for the Government to \\noutline its priorities for the year to come. The priority of our Government is \\nclearly to provide additional resources for vulnerable sections, rural areas \\nand social and physical infrastructure creation. The Government shall also \\nendeavour to continue with the ongoing reform programme and ensure the \\npassage of the Constitutional amendments to enable the implementation of \\nthe Goods and Service Tax, the passage of Insolvency and Bankruptcy law \\nand other important reform measures which are pending before the \\nParliament. \\n12. Additionally, as I will elaborate later, we will undertake significant \\nreforms, such as the enactment of a law to ensure that all Government \\nbenefits are conferred upon persons who deserve it, by giving a statutory \\nbacking to the AADHAR platform; bringing significant changes in the \\nlegislative framework relating to the transport sector so as to free it from \\nconstraints and restrictions; incentivising gas discovery and exploration by \\nproviding calibrated marketing freedom; enactment of a comprehensive law \\nto deal with resolution of financial firms; providing legal framework for \\ndispute resolution in PPP projects and public utility contracts; undertaking \\nimportant banking sector reforms and public listing of general insurance \\ncompanies; and undertaking significant changes in FDI policy. \\n13. Our agenda for the next year is, therefore, to ‘Transform India’ in this \\ndirection. My Budget proposals are, therefore, built on this transformative \\nagenda with nine distinct pillars. These include: \\n\\n\\x0c\\n4 \\n\\n(i) Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare: with focus on doubling \\nfarmers’ income in five years; \\n(ii) Rural Sector: with emphasis on rural employment and \\ninfrastructure; \\n(iii) Social Sector including Healthcare: to cover all under welfare \\nand health services; \\n(iv) Education, Skills and Job Creation: to make India a \\nknowledge based and productive society; \\n(v) Infrastructure and Investment: to enhance efficiency and \\nquality of life; \\n(vi) Financial Sector Reforms: to bring transparency and stability; \\n(vii) Governance and Ease of Doing Business: to enable the people \\nto realise their full potential; \\n(viii) Fiscal Discipline: prudent management of Government \\nfinances and delivery of benefits to the needy; and \\n(ix) Tax Reforms: to reduce compliance burden with faith in the \\ncitizenry. \\nIn each of these themes, I shall outline specific policy measures and \\ninitiatives which would have a transformative impact on our economy and \\nthe lives of our people. \\n\\nI. Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare \\n14. Let me first take up Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. We are \\ngrateful to our farmers for being the backbone of the country’s food security. \\nWe need to think beyond ‘food security’ and give back to our farmers a \\nsense of ‘income security’. Government will, therefore, reorient its \\ninterventions in the farm and non-farm sectors to double the income of the \\n\\nfarmers by 2022. Our total allocation for Agriculture and Farmers’ welfare \\n\\nis ` \\n35,984 crore. \\n\\n15. We need to address issues of optimal utilisation of our water \\nresources; create new infrastructure for irrigation; conserve soil fertility with \\nbalanced use of fertilizer; and provide value addition and connectivity from \\nfarm to markets. \\n16. Irrigation is a critical input for increasing agriculture production and \\nproductivity. Out of 141 million hectares of net cultivated area in the \\ncountry, only 46% is covered with irrigation. \\n\\x0c\\n5 \\n\\n17. The ‘Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana’ has been strengthened \\nand will be implemented in mission mode. 28.5 lakh hectares will be brought \\nunder irrigation under this Scheme. \\n18. Implementation of 89 irrigation projects under AIBP, which have \\nbeen languishing, will be fast tracked. This will help to irrigate 80.6 lakh \\nhectares. These projects require `17,000 crore next year and `86,500 crore \\nin the next five years. We will ensure that 23 of these projects are completed \\nbefore 31st March, 2017. \\n19. A dedicated Long Term Irrigation Fund will be created in \\nNABARD with an initial corpus of about `20,000 crore. To achieve all \\nthese, a total provision of `12,517 crore has been made through \\nbudgetary support and market borrowings in 2016-17. \\n20. Simultaneously a major programme for sustainable management \\nof ground water resources has been prepared with an estimated cost of \\n`6,000 crore and proposed for multilateral funding. \\n21. At least 5 lakh farm ponds and dug wells in rain fed areas and 10 lakh \\ncompost pits for production of organic manure will be taken up by making \\nproductive use of the allocations under MGNREGA. \\n22. The Soil Health Card Scheme is now being implemented with greater \\nvigour. Through this, farmers get information about nutrient level of the soil \\nand can make judicious use of fertilizers. The target is to cover all 14 crore \\nfarm holdings by March 2017. `368 crore has been provided for National \\nProject on Soil Health and Fertility. Besides, 2,000 model retail outlets of \\nFertilizer companies will be provided with soil and seed testing facilities \\nduring the next three years. Fertilizer companies will also co-market city \\ncompost which increases the efficacy of chemical fertilizer. A policy for \\nconversion of city waste into compost has also been approved by the \\nGovernment under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. \\n23. To increase crop yields in rain fed areas, which account for nearly \\n55% of the country’s arable land, organic farming is being promoted. \\n\\nTowards this end, the Government has launched two important schemes. \\nFirst, the ‘Parmparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana’ which will bring 5 lakh acres \\nunder organic farming over a three year period. Second, the Government has \\n\\nlaunched a value chain based organic farming scheme called “Organic Value \\nChain Development in North East Region”. The emphasis is on value \\n\\naddition so that organic produce grown in these parts find domestic and \\nexport markets. A total provision of `412 crore has been made for these \\nschemes. \\n\\n\\x0c\\n6 \\n\\n24. Incentives are being given for enhancement of pulses production. \\n`500 crores under National Food Security Mission has been assigned to \\npulses. The number of districts covered has been increased to 622. \\n25. A national level competition will be held among 674 Krishi Vigyan \\nKendras with a total prize money of `50 lakh to improve the efficiency \\nand performance of these Kendras. \\n26. Access to markets is critical for the income of farmers. The \\nGovernment is implementing the Unified Agriculture Marketing Scheme \\nwhich envisages a common e-market platform that will be deployed in \\nselected 585 regulated wholesale markets. Amendments to the APMC Acts \\nof the States are a pre-requisite to join this e-platform. I am happy to inform \\nthat 12 States have already amended their APMC Acts and are ready to come \\non board. More States are expected to join this platform in the coming year. \\nThe Unified Agricultural Marketing E Platform will be dedicated to the \\nNation on the birthday of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April this \\nyear. \\n\\n27. 97 lakh MT of storage capacity was added to the Central pool stock \\nduring the current year. \\n28. We are implementing the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana \\n(PMGSY) as never before. This Scheme had suffered in the past because of \\nunderfunding. The allocations in 2012-13 and 2013-14 were only `8,885 \\ncrore and `9,805 crore respectively. We have substantially increased the \\nallocation in the last two years and have now allocated `19,000 crore in \\n2016-17. Together with States’ share, totally about `27,000 crore will be \\nspent on this Yojana in 2016-17. Our goal is to advance the completion \\ntarget of the programme from 2021 to 2019 and connect the remaining \\n65,000 eligible habitations by constructing 2.23 lakh kms of roads. \\nAccordingly, the pace of construction which is currently 100 kms per day, as \\ncompared to the average of 73.5 kms during 2011-14, will be substantially \\nstepped up. \\n29. To support farmers in the aftermath of natural calamities, \\nGovernment has revised the norms of assistance under the National Disaster \\nResponse Fund in April 2015. \\n30. Special focus has been given to ensure adequate and timely flow of \\ncredit to the farmers. Against the target of `8.5 lakh crore in 2015-16, the \\ntarget for agricultural credit in 2016-17 will be an all-time high of `9 lakh \\ncrore. To reduce the burden of loan repayment on farmers, a provision of \\n`15,000 crore has been made in the BE 2016-17 towards interest subvention. \\n\\x0c\\n7 \\n\\n31. Government has approved the path breaking Crop Insurance Scheme, \\nnamely, Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana. For effective implementation of \\nthis Scheme, I have provided a sum of `5,500 crore in the Budget 2016-17. \\n32. We have to ensure that the benefit of MSP reaches farmers in all \\nparts of the country. Three specific initiatives will be taken up in 2016-17 \\nfor this. First, the remaining States will be encouraged to take up \\ndecentralized procurement. Second, an online Procurement System will \\nbe undertaken through the Food Corporation of India. This will usher \\nin transparency and convenience to the farmers through prior \\nregistration and monitoring of actual procurement. Third, effective \\narrangements have been made for pulses procurement. \\n33. Farmers also take up other allied activities to supplement their family \\nincome. To make dairying more remunerative to the farmers, four new \\nprojects will be taken up: first, the ‘Pashudhan Sanjivani’, an animal \\nwellness programme and provision of Animal Health Cards (‘Nakul \\n\\nSwasthya Patra’); second, an Advanced breeding technology; third, \\nCreation of ‘E-Pashudhan Haat’, an e market portal for connecting \\nbreeders and farmers; and fourth, a National Genomic Centre for \\nindigenous breeds. These projects will be implemented at a cost of `850 \\ncrores over the next few years. \\n\\n34. There has been a visible rise in the yield of honey, from an average of \\n18 to 20 kg per box per annum in the year 2013-14 to 25 kg per box per \\nannum by 2015-16. The total production of honey in the country has \\nincreased from 76,150 metric tonnes in 2014-15 to 86,500 metric tonnes. \\n90% of the domestic honey is now exported. \\nII. Rural Sector \\n35. After agriculture, I now turn to the other segments of the rural \\neconomy. \\n36. A sum of `2.87 lakh crore will be given as Grant in Aid to Gram \\nPanchayats and Municipalities as per the recommendations of the 14th \\nFinance Commission. This is a quantum jump of 228% compared to the \\nprevious five year period. The funds now allocated, translate to an average \\nassistance of over `80 lakh per Gram Panchayat and over `21 crore per \\nUrban Local Body. These enhanced allocations are capable of transforming \\nvillages and small towns. Ministry of Panchayati Raj will work with the \\nStates and evolve guidelines to actualise this. \\n\\x0c\\n8 \\n\\n37. There is an urgent need to focus on areas of drought and rural \\ndistress. Every block in these distress areas will be taken up as an intensive \\nBlock under the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Mission. Formation of Self Help \\nGroups (SHGs) will be speeded up to promote multiple livelihoods. Cluster \\nFacilitation Teams (CFT) will be set up under MGNREGS to ensure water \\nconservation and natural resource management. These districts would also \\nbe taken up on priority under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchaii Yojna. \\n38. A sum of `38,500 crore has been allocated for MGNREGS in \\n2016-17. \\n39. 300 Rurban Clusters will be developed under the Shyama Prasad \\nMukherjee Rurban Mission launched by the Honourable Prime Minister \\nrecently. These Clusters will incubate growth centres in rural areas by \\nproviding infrastructure amenities and market access for the farmers. They \\nwill also expand employment opportunities for the youth. \\n40. As on 1st April, 2015, a total of 18,542 villages were not electrified. \\nThe Honourable Prime Minister, in his address to the Nation on 15th August, \\n2015 announced that the remaining villages will be electrified within the \\nnext 1000 days. \\n41. As on 23rd February, 2016, 5542 villages have been electrified. This \\nis more than the total combined achievement of previous three years. The \\nGovernment is committed to achieve 100% village electrification by \\n1st May, 2018. ` \\n8,500 crore has been provided for Deendayal Upadhayaya \\nGram Jyoti Yojna and Integrated Power Development Schemes. \\n42. Swachh Bharat Mission is India’s biggest drive to improve sanitation \\nand cleanliness, especially in rural India. This subject was very close to the \\nheart of the Father of the Nation. For the first time since independence, the \\nParliament held a comprehensive debate on sanitation. This has become a \\ntopic of discussion in almost every home. We have introduced ranking of \\nurban areas in sanitation which has resulted in constructive competition \\namong towns and cities. ` \\n9,000 crore has been provided for Swachh Bharat \\nAbhiyan. \\n\\n43. In order to continue this momentum, priority allocation from \\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes will be made to reward villages that have \\nbecome free from open defecation. \\n44. We need to derive greater benefit from our demographic advantage. \\nWe need to spread digital literacy in rural India. Of the 16.8 crore rural \\nhouseholds as many as 12 crore households do not have computers and are \\n\\x0c\\n9 \\n\\nunlikely to have digitally literate persons. We have already approved two \\nSchemes to promote digital literacy: National Digital Literacy Mission; and \\nDigital Saksharta Abhiyan (DISHA). We now plan to launch a new Digital \\nLiteracy Mission Scheme for rural India to cover around 6 crore \\nadditional households within the next 3 years. Details of this scheme will \\nbe spelt out separately. \\n\\n45. Modernisation of land records is critical for dispute free titles. The \\nNational Land Record Modernisation Programme has been revamped under \\nthe Digital India Initiative and will be implemented as a Central sector \\nscheme with effect from 1st April, 2016. The revamped Programme will \\nbuild an integrated land information management system. `150 crore has \\nbeen provided for this purpose. \\n46. Panchayat Raj Institutions need to develop governance capabilities to \\ndeliver on the Sustainable Development Goals. It is, therefore, proposed to \\nlaunch a new restructured scheme, namely, Rashtriya Gram Swaraj \\nAbhiyan, for which `655 crore is being set apart in 2016-17. \\n47. For rural development as a whole, I have allocated ` \\n87,765 crore in \\nthe Budget for 2016-17. \\nIII. Social Sector including Health Care \\n48. When asked what he intends doing for regeneration of India, Swami \\nVivekananda had said “no amount of politics would be of any avail until the \\nmasses in India are well educated, well fed and well cared for”. I now \\nproceed to present the key elements of my proposals in the Social Sector. \\n\\n49. In our country, cooking gas cylinders were considered an upper \\nmiddle class luxury. Gradually it spread to the middle class. But the poor do \\nnot have access to cooking gas. Women of India have faced the curse of \\nsmoke during the process of cooking. According to experts having an open \\nfire in the kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an hour. The time has come \\nto remedy this situation. \\n50. We have decided to embark upon on a massive mission to \\nprovide LPG connection in the name of women members of poor \\nhouseholds. I have set aside a sum of `2,000 crore in this year’s Budget \\nto meet the initial cost of providing these LPG connections. This will \\nbenefit about 1 crore 50 lakh households below the poverty line in 2016-17. \\nThe Scheme will be continued for at least two more years to cover a total of \\n5 crore BPL households. This will ensure universal coverage of cooking gas \\n\\x0c\\n10 \\n\\nin the country. This measure will empower women and protect their health. \\nIt will reduce drudgery and the time spent on cooking. It will also provide \\nemployment for rural youth in the supply chain of cooking gas. \\n\\n51. I want to take this opportunity to express our gratitude and \\nappreciation for the 75 lakh middle class and lower middle class households \\nwho have voluntarily given up their cooking gas subsidy, in response to the \\ncall given by the Hon’ble Prime Minister. Their gesture is a matter of pride \\n\\nfor the country. \\n\\n52. Catastrophic health events are the single most important cause of \\nunforeseen out-of-pocket expenditure which pushes lakhs of households \\nbelow the poverty line every year. Serious illness of family members cause \\nsevere stress on the financial circumstances of poor and economically weak \\nfamilies, shaking the foundation of their economic security. In order to \\nhelp such families, the Government will launch a new health protection \\nscheme which will provide health cover up to Rs.One lakh per family. \\nFor senior citizens of age 60 years and above belonging to this category, \\nan additional top-up package up to `30,000 will be provided. \\n53. Making quality medicines available at affordable prices has been a \\nkey challenge. We will reinvigorate the supply of generic drugs. 3,000 \\nStores under Prime Minister’s Jan Aushadhi Yojana will be opened during \\n2016-17. \\n54. About 2.2 lakh new patients of End Stage Renal Disease get added in \\nIndia every year resulting in additional demand for 3.4 crore dialysis \\nsessions. With approximately 4,950 dialysis centres in India, largely in the \\nprivate sector and concentrated in the major towns, the demand is only half \\nmet. Every dialysis session costs about `2,000 – an annual expenditure of \\nmore than `3 lakh. Besides, most families have to undertake frequent trips, \\noften over long distances, to access dialysis services, incurring heavy travel \\ncosts and loss of wages. \\n55. To address this situation, I propose to start a ‘National Dialysis \\nServices Programme’. Funds will be made available through PPP mode \\nunder the National Health Mission, to provide dialysis services in all \\ndistrict hospitals. To reduce the cost, I propose to exempt certain parts \\nof dialysis equipment from basic customs duty, excise/CVD and SAD. \\n\\n56. Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe entrepreneurs are beginning to \\nshow great promise in starting and running successful business enterprises. \\nThe Prime Minister had given a call for promoting entrepreneurship among \\n\\x0c\\n11 \\n\\nSC/ST to become job providers rather than job seekers. I am happy to \\n\\ninform you that the Union Cabinet has approved the “Stand Up India \\nScheme” to promote entrepreneurship among SC/ST and women. ` \\n500 \\ncrore has been provided for this purpose. The Scheme will facilitate at least \\ntwo such projects per bank branch, one for each category of entrepreneur. \\nThis will benefit at least 2.5 lakh entrepreneurs. \\n\\n57. We are celebrating the 125th Birth Anniversary of Dr. B.R. \\nAmbedkar. This must become the Year of Economic Empowerment for \\nSC/ST entrepreneurs. We have extensively interacted with the Dalit India \\nChamber of Commerce and Industry on building an entrepreneurship ecosystem. \\nIt is proposed to constitute a National Scheduled Caste and \\nScheduled Tribe Hub in the MSME Ministry in partnership with industry \\nassociations. This Hub will provide professional support to Scheduled Caste \\nand Scheduled Tribe entrepreneurs to fulfil the obligations under the Central \\nGovernment procurement policy 2012, adopt global best practices and \\nleverage the Stand Up India initiative. \\n58. The schemes for welfare and skill development for Minorities such as \\nMulti-sectoral Development Programme and USTAAD shall be \\nimplemented effectively. \\nIV. Education, Skills and Job Creation \\n59. I would now like to highlight the steps proposed to be taken under \\neducation, skill development and job creation which is the fourth pillar of my \\nBudget proposals. \\nEducation \\n\\n60. After universalisation of primary education throughout the country, \\nwe want to take the next big step forward by focusing on the quality of \\neducation. An increasing share of allocation under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan \\nwill be allocated for this. Further, 62 new Navodaya Vidyalayas will be \\nopened in the remaining uncovered districts over the next two years. \\n61. It is our commitment to empower Higher Educational Institutions to \\nhelp them become world class teaching and research institutions. An \\nenabling regulatory architecture will be provided to ten public and ten \\nprivate institutions to emerge as world-class Teaching and Research \\nInstitutions. This will enhance affordable access to high quality education \\nfor ordinary Indians. A detailed scheme will be formulated. \\n62. We have decided to set up a Higher Education Financing Agency \\n(HEFA) with an initial capital base of `1,000 crores. The HEFA will be a \\n\\x0c\\n12 \\n\\nnot-for-profit organisation that will leverage funds from the market and \\nsupplement them with donations and CSR funds. These funds will be \\nused to finance improvement in infrastructure in our top institutions and will \\nbe serviced through internal accruals. \\n\\n63. To help Students, Higher Education Institutions and Employers to \\naccess degree certificates of candidates, it is proposed to establish a Digital \\nDepository for School Leaving Certificates, College Degrees, Academic \\nAwards and Mark sheets, on the pattern of a Securities Depository. This \\nwill help validate their authenticity, safe storage and easy retrieval. \\nSkill Development \\n\\n64. “Skill India” mission seeks to capitalise our demographic advantage. \\nSince its launch, the National Skill Development Mission has created an \\nelaborate skilling eco-system and imparted training to 76 lakh youth. We \\nwant to bring entrepreneurship to the doorsteps of youth through Pradhan \\nMantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). We have decided to set up 1500 \\nMulti Skill Training Institutes across the country. I am setting aside an \\namount of `1,700 crore for these initiatives. \\n\\n65. We have decided to set up a National Board for Skill Development \\nCertification in partnership with the industry and academia. We propose to \\nfurther scale up Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna to skill one crore \\nyouth over the next three years. \\n66. Entrepreneurship Education and Training will be provided in \\n2200 colleges, 300 schools, 500 Government ITIs and 50 Vocational \\nTraining Centres through Massive Open Online Courses. Aspiring \\nentrepreneurs, particularly those from remote parts of the country, will be \\nconnected to mentors and credit markets. \\nJob Creation \\n\\n67. In order to incentivize creation of new jobs in the formal sector, \\nGovernment of India will pay the Employee Pension Scheme \\ncontribution of 8.33% for all new employees enrolling in EPFO for the \\nfirst three years of their employment. This will incentivize the employers \\nto recruit unemployed persons and also to bring into the books the informal \\nemployees. In order to channelize this intervention towards the target group \\nof semi-skilled and unskilled workers, the scheme will be applicable to those \\nwith salary up to `15,000 per month. I have made a budget provision of \\n`1,000 crore for this scheme. \\n\\x0c\\n13 \\n\\n68. Further, the Finance Bill, 2016 proposes to broaden and liberalize the \\nscope of the employment generation incentive available under Section \\n80JJAA of the Income Tax Act. The deduction will be available not only to \\nassessees deriving income from manufacture of goods in a factory but to all \\nassessees who are subject to statutory audit under the Act. Thus, a deduction \\nof 30% of the emoluments paid to such employees can be claimed for three \\nyears. The minimum number of days for which they should be employed \\nduring the year is proposed to be reduced from 300 to 240 days. No \\ndeduction will, however, be admissible in respect of employees whose \\nmonthly emoluments exceed `25,000. Also, no deduction will be admissible \\nin respect of employees for whom the Government is paying the entire EPS \\ncontribution. \\n69. A National Career Service was launched in July, 2015. Already 35 \\nmillion jobs seekers have registered on this platform. We propose to make \\n100 Model Career Centres operational by the end of 2016-17. We also \\npropose to inter-link State Employment Exchanges with the National Career \\nService platform. \\n70. Retail Trade is the largest service sector employer in the country. \\nMany more jobs can be created in this sector, provided the regulations are \\nsimplified. If Shopping Malls are kept open all seven days of the week, \\nwhy not the small and medium shops? These shops should be given the \\nchoice to remain open on all seven days of the week on voluntary basis. \\nThe interest of the workers in terms of mandatory weekly holiday, number of \\nworking hours per day, etc., of course, have to be protected. We propose to \\ncirculate a Model Shops and Establishments Bill which can be adopted by \\nthe State Governments on voluntary basis. \\n\\nV. Infrastructure and Investment \\n71. The fifth support pillar of the Budget theme ‘Transform India’ is \\ninfrastructure and investment. \\n72. In the road sector, there were more than 70 projects that were \\nlanguishing at the beginning of the year, due to legacy factors. Aggregate \\nlength of these projects was about 8,300 kms involving more than `1 lakh \\ncrore investment. With exemplary and proactive interventions, nearly 85% \\nof these projects have been put back on track. \\n73. India’s highest ever kilometres of new highways were awarded in \\n2015. At the same time, India’s highest ever production of motor vehicles \\nwas achieved in 2015. This is a sign of growth in the economy; but it \\n\\x0c\\n14 \\n\\npresents a challenge also. Therefore, we have speeded up the process of road \\nconstruction. I have proposed an allocation of `55,000 crore in the Budget \\nfor Roads and Highways. This will be further topped up by additional \\n`15,000 crore to be raised by NHAI through bonds. Thus the total \\ninvestment in the road sector, including PMGSY allocation, would be \\n`97,000 crore during 2016-17. \\n\\n74. Together with the capital expenditure of the Railways, the total \\noutlay on roads and railways will be `2,18,000 crore in 2016-17. \\n75. We further expect to approve nearly 10,000 kms of National \\nHighways in 2016-17. This will be much higher than in the two previous \\nyears. The pace of completion of road projects will also rise to nearly 10,000 \\nkms in 2016-17. In addition, nearly 50,000 kms of State highways will also \\nbe taken up for up-gradation as National Highways. \\n76. The total outlay for infrastructure in BE 2016-17 stands at `2,21,246 \\ncrore. \\n77. Passenger traffic on our roads has to be made more efficient for the \\nbenefit of the common man and the middle class. This is a totally \\nunreformed sector which suffers from several impediments. Abolition of \\npermit-raj will be our medium term goal. Government will enact necessary \\namendments in the Motor Vehicles Act and open up the road transport \\nsector in the passenger segment. An enabling eco-system will be \\nprovided for the States which will have the choice of adopting the new \\nlegal framework. Entrepreneurs will be able to operate buses on various \\nroutes, subject to certain efficiency and safety norms. The major benefits of \\nthis game changing initiative will be provision of more efficient public \\ntransport facilities, greater public convenience, new investment in this \\nmoribund sector, creation of new jobs for our youth, growth of start-up \\nentrepreneurs and other multiplier effects. These measures will take us faster \\ndown the road to development. \\n78. In 2015, India’s major ports have handled the highest ever quality of \\ncargo. We have also added the highest ever capacity in major ports. We \\nhave started a series of measures for modernizing the ports and increasing \\ntheir efficiency. The Sagarmala project has already been rolled out. We are \\nplanning to develop new greenfield ports both in the eastern and western \\ncoasts of the country. The work on the National Waterways is also being \\nexpedited. `800 crore has been provided for these initiatives. \\n\\n79. In the civil aviation sector, the Government is drawing up an action \\nplan for revival of unserved and underserved airports. There are about 160 \\n\\x0c\\n15 \\n\\nairports and air strips with State Governments which can be revived at an \\nindicative cost of `50 crore to `100 crore each. We will partner with the \\nState Governments to develop some of these airports for regional \\nconnectivity. Similarly, 10 of the 25 non-functional air strips with the \\nAirport Authority of India will also be developed. \\n\\n80. India is blessed with rich natural resources including oil and gas. \\nHowever, their discovery and exploitation has been below our potential. \\nImports of hydrocarbons occupy a large share of India’s total imports. There \\n\\nis a situation of rising demand, near stagnation in production and consequent \\nrapid increase in imports. As part of our drive towards self-sufficiency, the \\nGovernment is considering to incentivise gas production from deep-water, \\nultra deep-water and high pressure-high temperature areas, which are \\npresently not exploited on account of higher cost and higher risks. A \\nproposal is under consideration for new discoveries and areas which are \\nyet to commence production, first, to provide calibrated marketing \\nfreedom; and second, to do so at a pre-determined ceiling price to be \\ndiscovered on the principle of landed price of alternative fuels. \\n\\n81. In the other segments of the infrastructure sector, our Government \\nhas achieved the highest coal production growth in over two decades, highest \\never capacity addition in generation, highest ever increase in transmission \\nlines and in distribution of LED bulbs. \\n82. In the power sector, we need to diversify the sources of power \\ngeneration for long term stability. Government is drawing up a \\ncomprehensive plan, spanning next 15 to 20 years, to augment the \\ninvestment in nuclear power generation. Budgetary allocation up to `3,000 \\ncrore per annum, together with public sector investments, will be leveraged \\nto facilitate the required investment for this purpose. \\n83. To augment infrastructure spending further, Government will permit \\nmobilisation of additional finances to the extent of `31,300 crore by NHAI, \\nPFC, REC, IREDA, NABARD and Inland Water Authority through raising \\nof Bonds during 2016-17. \\n84. Our private sector plays an important role in the development of \\ninfrastructure, many of which are implemented in the Public Private \\nPartnership (PPP) mode. I would like to announce three new initiatives to \\nreinvigorate this sector. \\n(i) A Public Utility (Resolution of Disputes) Bill will be \\nintroduced during 2016-17 to streamline institutional \\n\\x0c\\n16 \\n\\narrangements for resolution of disputes in infrastructure \\nrelated construction contracts, PPP and public utility \\ncontracts; \\n\\n(ii) Guidelines for renegotiation of PPP Concession \\nAgreements will be issued, keeping in view the long term \\nnature of such contracts and potential uncertainties of the \\nreal economy, without compromising transparency; \\n(iii) A new credit rating system for infrastructure projects \\nwhich gives emphasis to various in-built credit \\nenhancement structures will be developed, instead of \\nrelying upon a standard perception of risk which often \\nresult in mispriced loans. \\n85. I would like to announce further reforms in our FDI policy. The \\nchanges proposed are in the areas of insurance and pension, Asset \\nReconstruction Companies, Stock Exchanges, etc. Details of the changes are \\ngiven in Annex I of the Budget Speech. \\n86. The duty drawback scheme has been widened and deepened to \\ninclude more products and countries. The Government will continue to take \\nmeasures to support the export sector. \\n87. Our FDI policy has to address the requirements of farmers and food \\nprocessing industry. A lot of fruits and vegetables grown by our farmers \\neither do not fetch the right prices or fail to reach the markets. Food \\nprocessing industry and trade should be more efficient. 100% FDI will be \\nallowed through FIPB route in marketing of food products produced and \\nmanufactured in India. This will benefit farmers, give impetus to food \\nprocessing industry and create vast employment opportunities. \\n88. A new policy for management of Government investment in \\nPublic Sector Enterprises, including disinvestment and strategic sale, \\nhas been approved. We have to leverage the assets of CPSEs for generation \\nof resources for investment in new projects. We will encourage CPSEs to \\ndivest individual assets like land, manufacturing units, etc. to release \\ntheir asset value for making investment in new projects. The NITI Aayog \\nwill identify the CPSEs for strategic sale. \\n89. We will adopt a comprehensive approach for efficient management \\nof Government investment in CPSEs by addressing issues such as capital \\nrestructuring, dividend, bonus shares, etc. The Department of \\nDisinvestment is being re-named as the “Department of Investment and \\nPublic Asset Management (DIPAM)”. \\n\\x0c\\n17 \\n\\nVI. Financial Sector Reforms \\n90. A vibrant financial sector is of critical importance to the growth of \\nevery economy. In my last two Budgets, I had announced several measures \\nin this regard. I would now like to announce the following initiatives: \\n(i) A systemic vacuum exists with regard to bankruptcy situations \\nin financial firms. A comprehensive Code on Resolution of \\nFinancial Firms will be introduced as a Bill in the Parliament \\nduring 2016-17. This Code will provide a specialised \\nresolution mechanism to deal with bankruptcy situations in \\nbanks, insurance companies and financial sector entities. This \\nCode, together with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2015, \\nwhen enacted, will provide a comprehensive resolution \\nmechanism for our economy. \\n(ii) The RBI Act 1934, is being amended to provide statutory basis \\nfor a Monetary Policy Framework and a Monetary Policy \\nCommittee through the Finance Bill 2016. A committee-based \\napproach will add lot of value and transparency to monetary \\npolicy decisions. \\n(iii) A Financial Data Management Centre under the aegis of the \\nFinancial Stability Development Council (FSDC) will be set up \\nto facilitate integrated data aggregation and analysis in the \\nfinancial sector. \\n(iv) To improve greater retail participation in Government \\nsecurities, RBI will facilitate their participation in the primary \\nand secondary markets through stock exchanges and access to \\nNDS-OM trading platform. \\n(v) New derivative products will be developed by SEBI in the \\nCommodity Derivatives market. \\n(vi) To facilitate deepening of corporate bond market, a number \\nof measures will be undertaken, details of which are given in \\nAnnex II of the Budget Speech. The enactment of Insolvency \\nand Bankruptcy Code would provide a major boost to the \\ndevelopment of the corporate bond market. \\n(vii) To tackle the problem of stressed assets in the banking sector, \\nAsset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) have a very important \\nrole. I therefore, propose to make necessary amendments in \\nthe SARFAESI Act 2002 to enable the sponsor of an ARC to \\nhold up to 100% stake in the ARC and permit non-institutional \\ninvestors to invest in Securitization Receipts. \\n\\x0c\\n18 \\n\\n(viii) In the recent past, there have been rising instances of people in \\nvarious parts of the country being defrauded by illicit deposit \\ntaking schemes. The worst victims of these schemes are the \\npoor and the financially illiterate. The operation of such \\nschemes are often spread over many States. I, therefore, \\npropose to bring in comprehensive Central legislation in \\n2016-17 to deal with the menace of such schemes. \\n(ix) I also propose to amend the SEBI Act 1992 in the coming year \\nto provide for more members and benches of the Securities \\nAppellate Tribunal. \\n91. As the Honourable Members are well aware, the strength of the \\nfinancial sector is dependent upon a strong and well-functioning Banking \\nsystem. We already have a comprehensive ‘Plan For Revamping of Public \\nSector Banks’, INDRADHANUSH, which is under implementation. We are \\nnow confronted with the problem of stressed assets in Public Sector Banks, \\nwhich is a legacy from the past. Several steps have already been taken in \\nthis regard. We are not interfering in lending and personnel matters of the \\nBanks. Structural issues have been addressed in various sectors like Power, \\nCoal, Highways, Sugar and Steel. The Banks are putting in special efforts to \\neffect recoveries, with a focus on reviving stalled projects. \\n92. To support the Banks in these efforts as well as to support credit \\ngrowth, I have proposed an allocation of `25,000 crore in BE 2016-17 \\ntowards recapitalisation of Public Sector Banks. If additional capital is \\nrequired by these Banks, we will find the resources for doing so. We stand \\nsolidly behind these Banks. \\n93. Our Public Sector Banks will have to be strong and competitive. \\nThe Bank Board Bureau will be operationalized during 2016-17 and a \\nroadmap for consolidation of Public Sector Banks will be spelt out. The \\nprocess of transformation of IDBI Bank has already started. Government will \\ntake it forward and also consider the option of reducing its stake to below \\n50%. \\n94. For speedier resolution of stressed assets, the Debt Recovery \\nTribunals will be strengthened with focus on improving the existing \\ninfrastructure, including computerised processing of court cases, to support \\nreduction in the number of hearings and faster disposal of cases. \\n95. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) was launched for the \\nbenefit of bottom of the pyramid entrepreneurs. Banks and NBFC-MFIs \\n\\x0c\\n19 \\n\\nhave reported that the amount sanctioned under PMMY had reached about \\nRs.One lakh crore to over 2.5 crore borrowers by early February this year. \\npropose to increase the target next year to `1,80,000 crore. \\n\\n96. To provide better access to financial services, especially in rural \\nareas, we will undertake a massive nationwide rollout of ATMs and Micro \\nATMs in Post Offices over the next three years. \\n97. Public shareholding in Government-owned companies is a means of \\nensuring higher levels of transparency and accountability. To promote this \\nobjective, the general insurance companies owned by the Government will \\nbe listed in the stock exchanges. \\nVII. Governance and Ease of Doing Business \\n98. Our Government is giving unparalleled emphasis to good governance \\nwith special focus on process reforms, IT-enabled Government processes, \\netc. The whole idea is to remove the irritants for the public in their \\ninterface with Government agencies. \\n99. A Task Force has been constituted for rationalisation of human \\nresources in various Ministries. A comprehensive review and rationalisation \\nof autonomous bodies is also underway. \\n100. A critical component of minimum Government and maximum \\ngovernance is to ensure targeted disbursement of Government subsidies and \\nfinancial assistance to the actual beneficiaries. Public money should reach \\nthe poor and the deserving without any leakage. Three specific initiatives \\nare proposed to achieve this objective. \\n. \\nFirst, we will introduce a bill for Targeted Delivery of Financial and \\nOther Subsidies, Benefits and Services by using the Aadhar \\nframework. The bill will be introduced in the current Budget Session \\nof the Parliament. The Aadhar number or authentication shall not, \\nhowever, confer any right of citizenship or domicile. A social \\nsecurity platform will be developed using Aadhar to accurately target \\nbeneficiaries. This will be a transformative piece of legislation which \\nwill benefit the poor and the vulnerable. \\n. \\nSecond, we have already introduced Direct Benefit Transfer in LPG. \\nBased on this successful experience, we propose to introduce DBT on \\npilot basis for fertilizer in a few districts across the country, with a \\nview to improving the quality of service delivery to farmers. \\n. \\nThird, of the 5.35 lakh Fair Price Shops in the country, automation \\nfacilities will be provided in 3 lakh Fair Price Shops by March 2017. \\n\\x0c\\n20 \\n\\n101. We have to bring more transparency and efficiency in Government \\nprocurement of goods and services. The Director General of Supplies and \\nDisposal (DGS&D) will establish a technology driven platform to facilitate \\nprocurement of goods and services by various Ministries and agencies of the \\nGovernment. \\n102. To remove the difficulties and impediments to ease of doing \\nbusiness, we will introduce a bill to amend the Companies Act, 2013 in the \\ncurrent Budget Session of the Parliament. The Bill would also improve the \\nenabling environment for start-ups. The registration of companies will also \\nbe done in one day. \\n103. Monitoring of prices of essential commodities is a key element of \\ngood governance. A number of measures have been taken to deal with the \\nproblem of abrupt increase in prices of pulses. Government has approved \\ncreation of buffer stock of pulses through procurement at Minimum Support \\nPrice and at market price through Price Stabilisation Fund. This Fund has \\nbeen provided with a corpus of `900 crore to support market interventions. \\n104. Madam Speaker, for good governance, we have to capitalise on the \\ncountry’s unity in diversity. To strengthen understanding of each other, it is \\n\\nproposed to create a closer engagement between different States and Districts \\nin a structured manner. “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat” programme will be \\nlaunched to link States and Districts in an annual programme that \\nconnects people through exchanges in areas of language, trade, culture, \\ntravel and tourism. We will do this through mutual agreement with \\nparticipating States and Districts. \\n\\n105. In 2017, the country will celebrate 70th Anniversary of our \\nIndependence. We will chalk out milestones for nation’s journey beyond the \\n\\n70th Anniversary of Independence. Dr. Toynbee, the historian, had observed \\nthat “a chapter which had a Western beginning will have to have an Indian \\nending…..”. My belief is that the year 2017 will unfold the great historian’s \\ndream. Our scheme of “Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat” is part of this vision. \\n\\nVIII. Fiscal Discipline \\n106. Let me now elaborate on the fiscal situation in the context of the \\nBudget for the year 2016-17. \\n107. While preparing this Budget, I have received conflicting suggestions \\nabout the FRBM roadmap. Different schools of thought have argued either \\nin favour of fiscal consolidation and stability or for a less aggressive \\n\\x0c\\n21 \\n\\nconsolidation and for boosting growth. I have weighed the policy options \\nand decided that prudence lies in adhering to the fiscal targets. \\nConsequently, the fiscal deficit in RE 2015-16 and BE 2016-17 have been \\nretained at 3.9% and 3.5% of GDP respectively. While doing so, I have \\nensured that the development agenda has not been compromised. \\n\\n108. The total expenditure in the Budget for 2016-17 has been projected \\nat `19.78 lakh crore, consisting of `5.50 lakh crore under Plan and `14.28 \\nlakh crore under Non-Plan. The increase in Plan expenditure is in the order \\nof 15.3% over current year BE. Plan Allocations have given special \\nemphasis to sectors like agriculture, irrigation, social sector including health, \\nwomen and child development, welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled \\nTribes, minorities, infrastructure, etc. Continuing with the policy of higher \\nempowering States, the total resources being transferred to States are \\n`99,681 crore more over RE 2015-16 and `2,46,024 crore more over Actuals \\nof 2014-15. Details of allocations in certain vital sectors and schemes and \\ntransfers to States are given in Annex III to the Speech. \\n109. This is the last year of the 12th Plan. Successive committees have \\nquestioned the merit in having Plan and Non-Plan classification of \\nGovernment expenditure. A broad understanding over the years has been \\nthat Plan expenditures are good and Non-Plan expenditures are bad. This \\nresults in skewed allocations in the Budget. We need to correct this and give \\ngreater focus to Revenue and Capital classification of Government \\nexpenditure. We have, therefore, decided that the Plan-Non-Plan \\nclassification will be done away with from fiscal 2017-18. The Finance \\nMinistry will closely work with the State Finance Departments to align \\nCentral and State Budgets in this matter. \\n110. To improve the quality of Government expenditure, every new \\nscheme being sanctioned by Government will have a sunset date and \\noutcome review. A redeeming feature of this year’s Budget is that we \\nhave improved upon the Revenue Deficit target from 2.8% to 2.5% of GDP \\nin RE 2015-16. \\n111. The FRBM Act has been under implementation for more than a \\ndecade. Both Central and State Governments have made significant gains \\nfrom the implementation of this Act. There is now a school of thought \\nwhich believes that instead of fixed numbers as fiscal deficit targets, it may \\nbe better to have a fiscal deficit range as the target, which would give \\nnecessary policy space to the Government to deal with dynamic situations. \\nThere is also a suggestion that fiscal expansion or contraction should be \\naligned with credit contraction or expansion respectively, in the economy. \\n\\x0c\\n22 \\n\\nWhile remaining committed to fiscal prudence and consolidation, a time has \\ncome to review the working of the FRBM Act, especially in the context of \\nthe uncertainty and volatility which have become the new norms of global \\neconomy. I, therefore, propose to constitute a Committee to review the \\nimplementation of the FRBM Act and give its recommendations on the way \\nforward. \\n\\n112. As the Honourable Members are aware, the Seventh Central Pay \\nCommission has submitted its Report. Following the past practice, a \\nCommittee has been constituted to examine the Report and give its \\nrecommendations. In the meantime, I have made necessary interim \\nprovisions in the Budget. \\n113. We have rationalised and restructured more than 1500 Central Plan \\nSchemes into about 300 Central Sector and 30 Centrally Sponsored \\nSchemes. This will avoid overlapping of expenditure. I reiterate that I \\nremain committed to the financial requirements arising from economic \\npackages that have been announced by our Government and also \\ncommitments emanating from reorganisation of States. \\n114. I have also allocated initial sums of `100 crore each for celebrating \\nthe Birth Centenary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay and the 350th Birth \\nAnniversary of Guru Gobind Singh. \\nIX. Tax Reforms \\n115. I now turn to Tax Reforms which is elaborated in Part B of my \\nBudget Speech. \\n\\x0c\\n23 \\n\\nPART B \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\n116. I shall now present my tax proposals \\n117. The Government acknowledges the role of taxpayers in nation \\nbuilding. Each rupee of tax contributes towards the Government’s efforts to \\nprovide better infrastructure, rural revival and social well-being. Taxation is \\na major tool available to Government for removing poverty and inequality \\nfrom the society. The posterity will not forgive us if we do not use this \\nopportunity in this perspective. \\nThe thrust of my tax proposals this year falls in nine categories:\\n\\n\\n(1) Relief to small tax payers. \\n(2) Measures to boost growth and employment generation. \\n(3) Incentivizing domestic value addition to help Make in India. \\n(4) Measures for moving towards a pensioned society. \\n(5) Measures for promoting affordable housing. \\n(6) Additional resource mobilization for agriculture, rural economy \\nand clean environment. \\n(7) Reducing litigation and providing certainty in taxation. \\n(8) Simplification and rationalization of taxation. \\n(9) Use of Technology for creating accountability. \\nRelief to small tax payers \\n\\n118. In order to lessen tax burden on individuals with income not \\nexceeding `5 lakhs, I propose to raise the ceiling of tax rebate under section \\n87A from `2,000 to `5,000. There are 2 crore tax payers in this category \\nwho will get a relief of `3,000 in their tax liability. \\n119. The people who do not have any house of their own and also do not \\nget any house rent allowance from any employer today get a deduction of \\n`24,000 per annum from their income to compensate them for the rent they \\npay. I propose to increase the limit of deduction in respect of rent paid under \\nsection 80GG from `24,000 per annum to `60,000 per annum, which should \\nprovide relief to those who live in rented houses. \\n120. Presumptive taxation scheme under section 44AD of the Income Tax \\nAct is available for small and medium enterprises i.e non corporate \\nbusinesses with turnover or gross receipts not exceeding one crore rupees. \\n\\x0c\\n24 \\n\\nAt present about 33 lakh small business people avail of this benefit, which \\nfrees them from the burden of maintaining detailed books of account and \\ngetting audit done. I propose to increase the turnover limit under this scheme \\nto Rupees two crores which will bring big relief to a large number of \\nassesses in the MSME category. \\n\\n121. I also propose to extend the presumptive taxation scheme to \\nprofessionals with gross receipts up to `50 lakh with the presumption of \\nprofit being 50% of the gross receipts. \\nMeasures to boost growth and employment generation \\n\\n122. I had, in my last budget speech mooted the proposal to reduce the rate \\nof Corporate Tax from 30% to 25% over a period, accompanied by \\nrationalization and removal of various tax exemptions and incentives. In any \\ncase the effective rate of tax paid by companies comes to an average of 24.67 \\n% because of various exemptions which they are availing of. A phasing out \\nplan of removing these exemptions and tax incentives was placed in public \\ndomain and we have received a large number of constructive suggestions. \\nThe final plan of phasing out exemptions is given in Annexure. The \\nhighlights are as follows:(\\na) The accelerated depreciation provided under IT Act will be \\nlimited to maximum 40% from 1.4.2017. \\n(b) The benefit of deductions for Research would be limited to \\n150% from 1.4.2017 and 100% from 1.4.2020. \\n(c) The benefit of section 10AA to new SEZ units will be available \\nto those units which commence activity before 31.3.2020. \\n(d) The weighted deduction under section 35CCD for skill \\ndevelopment will continue up to 1.4.2020. \\n123. The reduction in corporate tax rate has to be calibrated with \\nadditional revenue expected from the incentives being phased out. The \\nbenefits from phasing out of exemptions are available to Government only \\ngradually. In the first phase, therefore, I propose the following two changes \\nin corporate income-tax rates:(\\na) The new manufacturing companies which are incorporated on \\nor after 1.3.2016 are proposed to be given an option to be taxed \\nat 25% + surcharge and cess provided they do not claim profit \\nlinked or investment linked deductions and do not avail of \\ninvestment allowance and accelerated depreciation. \\n(b) I also propose to lower the corporate income tax rate for the \\nnext financial year of relatively small enterprises i.e companies \\nwith turnover not exceeding `5 crore (in the financial year \\nending March 2015), to 29% plus surcharge and cess. \\n\\x0c\\n25 \\n\\n124. Startups generate employment, bring innovation and are expected to \\nbe key partners in Make in India programme. I propose to assist their \\npropagation through 100% deduction of profits for 3 out of 5 years for \\nstartups set up during April 2016 to March 2019. MAT will apply in such \\ncases. Capital gains will not be taxed if invested in regulated/notified Fund \\nof Funds and by individuals in notified startups, in which they hold majority \\nshares. \\n125. Research is the driver of innovation and innovation provides a thrust \\nto economic growth. I propose a special patent regime with 10% rate of tax \\non income from worldwide exploitation of patents developed and registered \\nin India. \\n126. In order to get more investment in Asset Reconstruction Companies \\n(ARCs) which play a very important role in resolution of bad debts, I \\npropose to provide complete pass through of income-tax to securitization \\ntrusts including trusts of ARCs. The income will be taxed in the hands of the \\ninvestors instead of the trust. However, the trust will be liable to deduct tax \\nat source. \\n127. The period for getting benefit of long term capital gain regime in case \\nof unlisted companies is proposed to be reduced from three to two years. \\n128. Non-banking financial companies shall be eligible for deduction to \\nthe extent of 5% of its income in respect of provision for bad and doubtful \\ndebts. \\n129. The determination of residency of foreign company on the basis of \\nPlace of Effective Management (POEM) is proposed to be deferred by one \\nyear. \\n130. I would like to reiterate our commitment to implement General Anti \\nAvoidance Rules (GAAR) from 1.4.2017. \\n131. In order to meet with our commitment to BEPS initiative of OECD \\nand G-20, the Finance Bill, 2016 includes provision for requirement of \\ncountry by country reporting for companies with a consolidated revenue of \\nmore than Euro 750 million. \\n132. I propose to exempt service tax on services provided under Deen \\nDayal Upadhyay Grameen Kaushalya Yojana and services provided by \\nAssessing Bodies empanelled by Ministry of Skill Development & \\nEntrepreneurship. \\n\\x0c\\n26 \\n\\n133. I propose to exempt service tax on general insurance services \\nprovided under ‘Niramaya’ Health Insurance Scheme launched by National \\n\\nTrust for the Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental \\nRetardation and Multiple Disability. \\n\\n134. To promote use of refrigerated containers, I propose to reduce the \\nbasic custom and excise duty on them to 5% and 6% respectively. \\n135. A number of assistive devices, rehabilitation aids and other goods for \\ndifferently abled (Divyang) persons attract Nil basic customs duty. I propose \\nto extend this exemption to Braille paper. \\nIncentivising domestic value addition to help Make in India. \\n\\n136. Customs and excise duty structure plays an important role in \\nincentivizing domestic value addition towards Make in India campaign of \\nour Government. In line with that, I propose to make suitable changes in \\ncustoms and excise duty rates on certain inputs, raw materials, intermediaries \\nand components and certain other goods and simplify procedures, so as to \\nreduce costs and improve competitiveness of domestic industry in sectors \\nlike Information technology hardware, capital goods, defence production, \\ntextiles, mineral fuels & mineral oils, chemicals & petrochemicals, paper, \\npaperboard & newsprint, Maintenance repair and overhauling [MRO] of \\naircrafts and ship repair etc. Details of such changes are given in the \\nAnnexure to Budget Speech. \\nMeasures for moving towards a pensioned society \\n\\n137. Pension schemes offer financial protection to senior citizens. I \\nbelieve that the tax treatment should be uniform for defined benefit and \\ndefined contribution pension plans. I propose to make withdrawal up to 40% \\nof the corpus at the time of retirement tax exempt in the case of National \\nPension Scheme. \\n138. In case of superannuation funds and recognized provident funds, \\nincluding EPF, the same norm of 40% of corpus to be tax free will apply in \\nrespect of corpus created out of contributions made after 1.4.2016. \\n139. Further, the annuity fund which goes to the legal heir after the death \\nof pensioner will not be taxable in all three cases. Also, we are proposing a \\nmonetary limit for contribution of employer in recognized Provident and \\nSuperannuation Fund of `1.5 lakh per annum for taking tax benefit. \\n140. I propose to exempt from service tax the Annuity services provided \\nby the National Pension System (NPS) and Services provided by EPFO to \\nemployees. \\n\\x0c\\n27 \\n\\n141. I also propose to reduce service tax on Single premium Annuity \\n(Insurance) Policies from 3.5% to 1.4% of the premium paid in certain cases. \\nMeasures for promoting affordable housing \\n\\n142. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna embodies the assurance of the \\nGovernment to address the housing needs of all and more specifically the \\npoor, in a time bound manner. Construction of houses creates considerable \\nemployment opportunities as well. In order to fuel activity in the housing \\nsector, I propose to give 100% deduction for profits to an undertaking from a \\nhousing project for flats upto 30 sq. metres in four metro cities and 60 sq. \\nmetres in other cities, approved during June 2016 to March 2019, and is \\ncompleted within three years of the approval. Minimum Alternate Tax will, \\nhowever, apply to these undertakings. \\n143. For the ‘first – home buyers’, I propose to give deduction for \\nadditional interest of `50,000 per annum for loans up to `35 lakh sanctioned \\nduring the next financial year, provided the value of the house does not \\nexceed `50 lakh. \\n144. Another proposal to stimulate housing activity is to facilitate \\ninvestments in Real Estate Investment Trusts. I propose that any distribution \\nmade out of income of SPV to the REITs and INVITs having specified \\nshareholding will not be subjected to Dividend Distribution Tax. \\n145. It is proposed to exempt service tax on construction of affordable \\nhouses up to 60 square metres under any scheme of the Central or State \\nGovernment including PPP Schemes. \\n146. I also propose to extend excise duty exemption, presently available to \\nConcrete Mix manufactured at site for use in construction work at such site \\nto Ready Mix Concrete. \\nAdditional resource mobilization for agriculture, rural economy and \\nclean environment \\n\\n147. Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) uniformly applies to all investors \\nirrespective of their income slabs. This is perceived to distort the fairness and \\nprogressive nature of taxes. Persons with relatively higher income can bear a \\nhigher tax cost. I, therefore, propose that in addition to DDT paid by the \\ncompanies, tax at the rate of 10% of gross amount of dividend will be \\npayable by the recipients, that is, individuals, HUFs and firms receiving \\ndividend in excess of `10 lakh per annum. \\n\\x0c\\n28 \\n\\n148. I also propose to raise the surcharge from 12% to 15% on persons, \\nother than companies, firms and cooperative societies having income above \\n`1 crore. \\n149. I also propose to collect tax at source at the rate of 1% on purchase of \\nluxury cars exceeding value of Rs.ten lakh and purchase of goods and \\nservices in cash exceeding Rs.two lakh. For compliant tax payers with \\nresources, this levy not only advances collection of tax when the expenditure \\nis incurred, but it provides data to the tax authorities to identify the persons \\nwho incur such expenditure, but may be missing from the tax base. Farmers \\nand notified class of persons will have an option of giving a form by which \\nTCS will not be charged. \\n150. Rate of Securities Transaction tax in case of ‘Options’ is proposed to \\nbe increased from .017% to .05%. \\n\\n151. In order to tap tax on income accruing to foreign e-commerce \\ncompanies from India, it is proposed that a person making payment to a nonresident, \\nwho does not have a permanent establishment, exceeding in \\naggregate `1 lakh in a year, as consideration for online advertisement, will \\nwithhold tax at 6% of gross amount paid, as Equalization levy. The levy will \\nonly apply to B2B transactions. \\n152. I propose to impose a Cess, called the Krishi Kalyan Cess, @ 0.5% \\non all taxable services, proceeds of which would be exclusively used for \\nfinancing initiatives relating to improvement of agriculture and welfare of \\nfarmers. The Cess will come into force with effect from 1st June 2016. Input \\nTax credit of this cess will be available for payment of this cess. \\n153. The pollution and traffic situation in Indian cities is a matter of \\nconcern. I propose to levy an infrastructure cess, of 1% on small petrol, \\nLPG, CNG cars, 2.5% on diesel cars of certain capacity and 4% on other \\nhigher engine capacity vehicles and SUVs. \\n154. I also propose to impose an excise duty of ‘1% without input tax \\ncredit or 12.5% with input tax credit’ on articles of jewellery [excluding \\nsilver jewellery, other than studded with diamonds and some other precious \\nstones], with a higher exemption and eligibility limits of ` \\n6 crores and ` \\n12 \\ncrores respectively. Necessary steps will also be taken to enable the new \\ntaxpayers to comply with this levy without any difficulty. \\n\\n155. I propose to change the excise duty on branded readymade garments \\nand made up articles of textiles with a retail sale price of `1,000 and above \\nfrom ‘Nil without input tax credit or 6%/12.5% with input tax credit’ to ‘2% \\nwithout input tax credit or 12.5% with input tax credit’. \\n\\n\\x0c\\n29 \\n\\n156. I propose to rename the ‘Clean Energy Cess’ levied on coal, lignite \\nand peat as ‘Clean Environment Cess’ and simultaneously increase its rate \\nfrom `200 per tonne to `400 per tonne. \\n157. To discourage consumption of tobacco and tobacco products, I \\npropose to increase the excise duties on various tobacco products other than \\nbeedi by about 10 to 15%. \\n158. I propose to amend the Finance Act, 1994 so as to declare assignment \\nby the Government of the right to use the radio-frequency spectrum and its \\nsubsequent transfers a service, to make it clear that assignment of right to use \\nthe spectrum is a service leviable to service tax and not sale of intangible \\ngoods. \\nReducing litigation and providing certainty in taxation \\n\\n159. We are moving towards a lower tax regime with non-litigious \\napproach. Thus, while compliant taxpayers can expect a supportive interface \\nwith the department, tax evasion will be countered strongly. Capability of \\nthe tax department to detect tax evasion has improved because of enhanced \\naccess to information and availability of technology driven analytical tools \\nto process such information. I want to give an opportunity to the earlier non-\\ncompliant to move to the category of compliant. \\n160. I propose a limited period Compliance Window for domestic \\ntaxpayers to declare undisclosed income or income represented in the form \\nof any asset and clear up their past tax transgressions by paying tax at 30%, \\nand surcharge at 7.5% and penalty at 7.5%, which is a total of 45% of the \\nundisclosed income. There will be no scrutiny or enquiry regarding income \\ndeclared in these declarations under the Income Tax Act or the Wealth Tax \\nAct and the declarants will have immunity from prosecution. Immunity from \\nBenami Transaction (Prohibition) Act, 1988 is also proposed subject to \\ncertain conditions. The surcharge levied at 7.5% of undisclosed income will \\nbe called Krishi Kalyan surcharge to be used for agriculture and rural \\neconomy. We plan to open the window under this Income Disclosure \\nScheme from 1st June to 30th September, 2016 with an option to pay amount \\ndue within two months of declaration. \\n161. Our Government is fully committed to remove black money from the \\neconomy. Having given one opportunity for evaded income to be declared \\nonce, we would then like to focus all our resources for bringing people with \\nblack money to books. \\n162. Litigation is a scourge for a tax friendly regime and creates an \\nenvironment of distrust in addition to increasing the compliance cost of the \\ntax payers and administrative cost for the Government. There are about 3 \\nlakh tax cases pending with the 1st Appellate Authority with disputed amount \\n\\x0c\\n30 \\n\\nbeing 5.5 lakh crores. In order to reduce this number, I propose a new \\nDispute Resolution Scheme (DRS). \\n\\n163. A taxpayer who has an appeal pending as of today before the \\nCommissioner (Appeals) can settle his case by paying the disputed tax and \\ninterest up to the date of assessment. No penalty in respect of Income-tax \\ncases with disputed tax up to ` \\n10 lakh will be levied. Cases with disputed \\ntax exceeding ` \\n10 lakh will be subjected to only 25% of the minimum of the \\nimposable penalty for both direct and indirect taxes. Any pending appeal \\nagainst a penalty order can also be settled by paying 25% of the minimum of \\nthe imposable penalty. Certain categories of persons including those who are \\ncharged with criminal offences under specific Acts are proposed to be barred \\nfrom availing this scheme. \\n164. I had in my Budget speech of July, 2014 assured that this \\nGovernment would not retrospectively create a fresh tax liability. I had also \\nhoped then that the cases pending in various courts and other legal fora \\nrelating to certain retrospective amendments undertaken to the Income-tax \\nAct, 1961, through the Finance Act, 2012 will soon reach their logical \\nconclusion. I would like to reiterate that we are committed to provide a \\nstable and predictable taxation regime. We will not resort to such \\namendments in future. I had also announced constitution of a High Level \\nCommittee which would oversee any fresh case where the assessing officer \\nproposes to assess or reassess the income in respect of indirect transfers by \\napplying the retrospective amendment. In order to allay any fears of tax \\nadventurism, this Committee will now be chaired by the Revenue Secretary \\nand consist of Chairman, CBDT and an expert from outside. This \\nCommittee will effectively oversee the implementation of the assurances. \\n165. In order to give an opportunity to the past cases which are ongoing \\nunder the retrospective amendment, I propose a one-time scheme of Dispute \\nResolution for them, in which, subject to their agreeing to withdraw any \\npending case lying in any Court or Tribunal or any proceeding for \\narbitration, mediation etc. under BIPA, they can settle the case by paying \\nonly the tax arrears in which case liability of the interest and penalty shall be \\nwaived. \\n166. Levy of heavy penalty for concealment of income has over the years \\nresulted in large number of disputes despite a number of decisions of the \\nApex court on interpretation of statutory provisions and principles guiding \\nimposition of penalty. At present the Income-tax Officer has discretion to \\nlevy penalty at the rate of 100% to 300% of tax sought to be evaded. \\npropose to modify the entire scheme of penalty by providing different \\ncategories of misdemeanor with graded penalty and thereby substantially \\nreducing the discretionary power of the tax officers. The penalty rates will \\nnow be 50% of tax in case of underreporting of income and 200% of tax \\n\\x0c\\n31 \\n\\nwhere there is misreporting of facts. Remission of penalty is also proposed \\nin certain circumstances where taxes are paid and appeal is not filed. \\n\\n167. Another issue which has led to considerable number of disputes is \\nquantification of disallowance of expenditure relatable to exempt income in \\nterms of Section 14A of the Income Tax Act. I propose to rationalize the \\nformula in Rule 8D governing such quantification. The said Rule is being \\namended to provide that disallowance will be limited to 1% of the average \\nmonthly value of investments yielding exempt income, but not exceeding the \\nactual expenditure claimed. \\n168. As another tax payer friendly measure, I propose to provide a time \\nlimit of one year for disposing petitions of the tax payers seeking waiver of \\ninterest and penalty. \\n169. The Income-tax Department is also issuing instruction making it \\nmandatory for the assessing officer to grant stay of demand once the assesse \\npays 15% of the disputed demand, while the appeal is pending before \\nCommissioner of Income-tax (Appeals). In case of deviation, assessing \\nofficer has to get orders of his superiors. The tax payer also has an option to \\ngo to superior officer in case he does not agree with conditions of stay order \\npassed by the subordinate officer. \\n170. In order to remove backlog of cases we are creating 11 new benches \\nof Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT). \\n171. The monetary limit for deciding an appeal by a single member Bench \\nof ITAT is proposed to be enhanced from `15 lakhs to `50 lakhs. \\n172. I also propose to amend the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, so as to \\nimprove credit flow, reduce the compliance burden and associated litigation, \\nparticularly those relating to apportionment of credit between exempted and \\nnon exempted final products/services. The amendments in these rules will \\nalso enable manufacturers with multiple manufacturing units to maintain a \\ncommon warehouse for inputs and distribute inputs with credits to the \\nindividual manufacturing units. \\nSimplification and rationalization of taxation \\n\\n173. The Government has already accepted many recommendations of \\nTax Administration Reform Committee and I propose to accept a number of \\nrecommendations of Justice Easwar Committee in this Budget. \\n174. To reduce multiplicity of taxes, associated cascading and to reduce \\ncost of collection, I propose to abolish 13 cesses, levied by various Ministries \\nin which revenue collection is less than `50 crore in a year. \\n\\x0c\\n32 \\n\\n175. To improve the cash flow position of small tax payers who get their \\nfunds blocked due to current TDS provision, I propose to rationalize TDS \\nprovisions for Income Tax as per Annexure. \\n176. Non-residents without PAN are currently subjected to a higher rate of \\nTDS. It is proposed to amend the relevant provision to provide that on \\nfurnishing of alternative documents, the higher rate will not apply. \\n177. The facility for revision of return, hitherto available to a service tax \\nassessee only, is being extended to Central Excise assessees also. \\n178. I propose to provide additional options to banking companies and \\nfinancial institutions, including non-banking financial companies, for \\nreversal of input tax credits with respect to non-taxable services provided by \\nthem by way of extending deposits, loans and advances. \\n179. Our Government has taken a number of steps to reduce the cargo \\nrelease time and the transaction costs of EXIM trade. I propose to amend the \\nCustoms Act to provide for deferred payment of customs duties for importers \\nand exporters with proven track record. \\n180. In 2014-15 Budget, I had announced the intent to implement Indian \\nCustoms Single Window Project. We have made significant progress in this \\nand it would be implemented at major ports and airports starting from \\nbeginning of next financial year. \\n181. The customs Baggage Rules for international passengers are being \\nsimplified so as to increase the free baggage allowance. The filing of \\nbaggage declaration will be required only for those passengers who carry \\ndutiable goods. \\nUse of Technology for creating accountability \\n\\n182. Technology is a boon for mankind. We plan to use technology in \\ntaxation Department in a big way to make life simpler for a law abiding \\ncitizen, and also for data mining to track tax evaders. \\n183. A pilot was run in 2015-16 for e-assessment to obviate the \\nrequirement for tax payers to visit the Income-tax offices. I propose to \\nexpand the scope of e-assessments to all assessees in 7 mega cities in the \\ncoming years. The cases selected for scrutiny will be scrutinized in \\ne-environment whereby unless the assessee himself wants to be heard, or for \\nspecial reasons to be recorded, the assessing officer wants to hear the party, \\nthere will be no face to face contact of IT Department with assessee. \\n184. Income-tax Department (ITD) will fully expand the pilot initiative of \\n‘e-Sahyog’ with a view to reduce compliance cost, especially for small \\n\\x0c\\n33 \\n\\ntaxpayers. The objective of the ‘e-Sahyog’ pilot project is to provide an \\nonline mechanism to resolve mismatches in Income-tax returns without \\nrequiring taxpayers to attend the Income-tax office. \\n\\n185. I propose that in matters pertaining to Income-tax Act, Government \\nwill pay interest at the rate of 9% p.a against normal rate of 6% p.a in case \\nthere is delay in giving effect to Appellate order beyond ninety days. The \\nofficers who delay it, will be accountable for this loss to Government. \\n186. I also propose to change the procedure to provide for a shift from \\nphysical control to record based control for customs bonded warehouses, \\nsupported by sophisticated IT systems. \\n187. Madam Speaker, my direct tax proposals would result in revenue loss \\nof ` \\n1,060 crore and my indirect proposals are expected to yield `20,670 \\ncrores. Thus the net impact of all tax proposals would be revenue gain of \\n`19,610 crores. \\nCONCLUSION \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\n188. This Budget is being presented amidst global and domestic \\nheadwinds. There are several challenges. We see them as opportunities. I \\nhave outlined the agenda of our Government to ‘Transform India’ for the \\n\\nbenefit of the farmers, the poor and the vulnerable. \\n\\n189. Madam Speaker, it is said that “Champions are made from something \\nthey have deep inside of them -a desire, a dream, a vision”. We have a \\ndesire to provide socio-economic security to every Indian, especially the \\nfarmers, the poor and the vulnerable; we have a dream to see a more \\nprosperous India; and a vision to ‘Transform India’. \\n190. With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the \\nHouse. \\n\\x0c\\n34 \\n\\nAnnex No. I to Part A \\n\\nPROPOSED CHANGES/REFORMS IN FDI AND \\nRELATED POLICIES \\n\\n(i) Foreign investment will be allowed in the insurance and pension \\nsectors in the automatic route up to 49% subject to the extant \\nguidelines on Indian management and control to be verified by the \\nRegulators. \\n(ii) 100% FDI in Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) will be \\npermitted through automatic route. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) \\nwill be allowed up to 100% of each tranche in securities receipts issued \\nby ARCs subject to sectoral caps. \\n(iii) Investment limit for foreign entities in Indian stock exchanges will be \\nenhanced from 5 to 15% on par with domestic institutions. This will \\nenhance global competitiveness of Indian stock exchanges and \\naccelerate adoption of best-in-class technology and global market \\npractices. \\n(iv) The existing 24% limit for investment by FPIs in Central Public Sector \\nEnterprises, other than Banks, listed in stock exchanges, will be \\nincreased to 49% to obviate the need for prior approval of Government \\nfor increasing the FPI investment. \\n(v) The basket of eligible FDI instruments will be expanded to include \\nhybrid instruments subject to certain conditions. \\n(vi) FDI will be allowed beyond the 18 specified NBFC activities in the \\nautomatic route in other activities which are regulated by financial \\nsector regulators. \\n(vii) With a view to promote Make in India and following the practices in \\nadvanced countries, foreign investors will be accorded Residency \\nStatus subject to certain conditions. Currently, these investors are \\ngranted business visa only up to 5 years at a time. \\n(viii) In order to ensure effective implementation of Bilateral Investment \\nTreaties signed by India with other countries, I propose to introduce a \\nCentre State Investment Agreement. This will ensure fulfilment of the \\nobligations of the State Governments under these Treaties.

There was also expectation for a major change in the way the \\ncountry’s natural resources were allocated, processed and deployed. \\n\\n\\n3. In the last two and half years, it has been our mission to bring a \\nTransformative Shift in the way our country is governed. We have moved \\n\\n. from a discretionary administration to a policy and system \\nbased administration; \\n. from favouritism to transparency and objectivity in decision \\nmaking; \\n. from blanket and loose entitlements to targeted delivery; and \\n. from informal economy to formal economy. \\n\\n\\nInflation, which was in double digits, has been controlled; sluggish growth \\nhas been replaced by high growth; and a massive war against black money \\nhas been launched. We have worked tirelessly on all these fronts and feel \\nencouraged by the unstinted support of the people to our initiatives. The \\nGovernment is now seen as a trusted custodian of public money. I take this \\nopportunity to express our gratitude to the people of India for their strong \\nsupport. \\n\\n4. We shall continue to undertake many more measures to ensure that \\nthe fruits of growth reach the farmers, the workers, the poor, the scheduled \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ncastes and scheduled tribes, women and other vulnerable sections of our \\nsociety. Our focus will be on energising our youth to reap the benefits of \\ngrowth and employment. \\n5. Madam Speaker, I am presenting this Budget when the world \\neconomy faces considerable uncertainty, in the aftermath of major \\neconomic and political developments during the last one year. \\nNevertheless, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that world \\nGDP will grow by 3.1% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017. The advanced economies \\nare expected to increase their growth from 1.6% to 1.9% and the emerging \\neconomies from 4.1% to 4.5%. As per current indications, macro-economic \\npolicy is expected to be more expansionary in certain large economies. \\nGrowth in a number of emerging economies is expected to recover in 2017, \\nafter relatively poor performance in 2016. These are positive signs and \\npoint to an optimistic outlook for the next year. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n6. There are, however, three major challenges for emerging \\neconomies. First, the current monetary policy stance of the US Federal \\nReserve, to increase the policy rates more than once in 2017, may lead to \\nlower capital inflows and higher outflows from the emerging economies. \\nSecond, the uncertainty around commodity prices, especially that of crude \\noil, has implications for the fiscal situation of emerging economies. It is \\nhowever expected that increase, if any, in oil prices would get tempered by \\nquick response from producers of shale gas and oil. This would have a \\nsobering impact on prices of crude and petroleum. Third, in several parts of \\nthe world, there are signs of increasing retreat from globalisation of goods, \\nservices and people, as pressures for protectionism are building up. These \\ndevelopments have the potential to affect exports from a number of \\nemerging markets, including India. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n7. Amidst all these developments, India stands out as a bright spot in \\nthe world economic landscape. India’s macro-economic stability continues \\nto be the foundation of economic success. CPI inflation declined from 6% in \\nJuly 2016 to 3.4% in December, 2016 and is expected to remain within RBI’s \\nmandated range of 2% to 6%. Favourable price developments reflect \\nprudent macro-economic management, resulting in higher agricultural \\nproduction, especially in pulses. India’s Current Account Deficit declined \\nfrom about 1% of GDP last year to 0.3% of GDP in the first half of 2016-17. \\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) increased from ` 1,07,000 crores in the first \\nhalf of last year to ` 1,45,000 crores in the first half of 2016-17. This marks \\nan increase by 36%, despite 5% reduction in global FDI inflows. Foreign \\nexchange reserves have reached 361 billion US Dollars as on 20th January, \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n2017, which represents a comfortable cover for about 12 months of \\nimports. \\n8. The Government has also continued on the steady path of fiscal \\nconsolidation, without compromising on the public investment \\nrequirements of the economy. Externally, the economy successfully \\nweathered a number of shocks, the redemption of FCNR deposits, volatility \\nfrom the US elections and the Fed rate hike. According to IMF forecast, \\nIndia is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in 2017. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n9. A number of global reports and assessments, over the last two \\nyears, have shown that India has considerably improved its policies, \\npractices and economic profile. These are reflected in Doing Business \\nReport of the World Bank; World Investment Report 2016 of UNCTAD; \\nGlobal Competitiveness Report of 2015-16 and 2016-17 of the World \\nEconomic Forum; and several other Reports. India has become the sixth \\nlargest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth previously. We \\nare seen as an engine of global growth. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n10. In the last one year, our country has witnessed historic and \\nimpactful economic reforms and policy making. In fact, India was one of the \\nvery few economies undertaking transformational reforms. There were two \\ntectonic policy initiatives, namely, passage of the Constitution Amendment \\nBill for GST and the progress for its implementation ; and demonetisation of \\nhigh denomination bank notes. The advantages of GST for our economy in \\nterms of spurring growth, competitiveness, indirect tax simplification and \\ngreater transparency have already been extensively discussed in both \\nHouses of Parliament. I thank all Members of both the Houses for having \\npassed the Constitution Amendment unanimously. I also thank the State \\nGovernments for resolving all relevant issues in the GST Council. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n11. Demonetisation of high denomination bank notes was in \\ncontinuation of a series of measures taken by our Government during the \\nlast two years. It is a bold and decisive measure. For several decades, tax \\nevasion for many has become a way of life. This compromises the larger \\npublic interest and creates unjust enrichment in favour of the tax evader, to \\nthe detriment of the poor and deprived. This has bred a parallel economy \\nwhich is unacceptable for an inclusive society. Demonetisation seeks to \\ncreate a new ‘normal’ wherein the GDP would be bigger, cleaner and real. \\nThis exercise is part of our Government’s resolve to eliminate corruption, \\nblack money, counterfeit currency and terror funding. Like all reforms, this \\nmeasure is obviously disruptive, as it seeks to change the retrograde status \\nquo. Drop in economic activity, if any, on account of the currency squeeze \\nduring the remonetisation period is expected to have only a transient \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nimpact on the economy. I am reminded here of what the Father of the \\nNation, Mahatma Gandhi, had said: “A right cause never fails”. \\n12. Demonetisation has strong potential to generate long-term benefits \\nin terms of reduced corruption, greater digitisation of the economy, \\nincreased flow of financial savings and greater formalisation of the \\neconomy, all of which would eventually lead to higher GDP growth and tax \\nrevenues. Demonetisation helps to transfer resources from the tax evaders \\nto the Government, which can use these resources for the welfare of the \\npoor and the deprived. There is early evidence of an increased capacity of \\nBanks to lend at reduced interest rates and a huge shift towards digitisation \\namong all sections of society. We firmly believe that demonetisation and \\nGST which were built on the third transformational achievement of our \\nGovernment, namely, the JAM vision, will have an epoch making impact on \\nour economy and the lives of our people. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n13. Madam Speaker, we are at an important turning point in the path of \\nour growth and development. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n<ºÉ àÉÉä½ {É® PÉ¤É®É BÉäE xÉ lÉàÉ VÉÉ<A +ÉÉ{É \\n\\nVÉÉä ¤ÉÉiÉ xÉªÉÉÒ cè =ºÉä +É{ÉxÉÉ<A +ÉÉ{É \\n\\nb®iÉä cé xÉªÉÉÒ ®Éc {Éä BÉDªÉÉå SÉãÉxÉä ºÉä \\n\\ncàÉ +ÉÉMÉä-+ÉÉMÉä SÉãÉiÉä cé +ÉÉVÉÉ<A +ÉÉ{É \\n\\n \\n\\n14. The pace of remonetisation has picked up and will soon reach \\ncomfortable levels. The effects of demonetisation are not expected to spill \\nover into the next year. Thus IMF, even while revising India’s GDP forecast \\nfor 2016 downwards, has projected a GDP growth of 7.2% and 7.7% in 2017 \\nand 2018 respectively. The World Bank, however, is more optimistic and \\nhas projected a GDP growth of 7% in 2016-17, 7.6% in 2017-18 and 7.8% in \\n2018-19. This pick up in our economy is premised upon our policy and \\ndetermination to continue with economic reforms; increase in public \\ninvestment in infrastructure and development projects; and export growth \\nin the context of the expected rebound in world economy. The surplus \\nliquidity in the banking system, created by demonetisation, will lower \\nborrowing costs and increase the access to credit. This will boost economic \\nactivity, with multiplier effects. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n15. The announcements made by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st \\nDecember, 2016 address many of the key concerns of our economy at this \\njuncture, such as, housing for the poor; relief to farmers; credit support to \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nMSMEs; encouragement to digital transactions; assistance to pregnant \\nwomen and senior citizens; and priority to dalits, tribals, backward classes \\nand women under the Mudra Yojana. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n16. My overall approach, while preparing this Budget, has been to spend \\nmore in rural areas, infrastructure and poverty alleviation and yet maintain \\nthe best standards of fiscal prudence. I have also kept in mind the need to \\ncontinue with economic reforms, promote higher investments and \\naccelerate growth. \\n17. The last one year was a witness to other major reforms, namely, \\nenactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code; amendment to the RBI \\nAct for inflation targeting; enactment of the Aadhar bill for disbursement of \\nfinancial subsidies and benefits; significant reforms in FDI policy; the job \\ncreating package for textile sector; and several other measures. We will \\ncontinue the process of economic reforms for the benefit of the poor and \\nthe underprivileged. \\n18. Madam Speaker, the Budget for 2017-18 contains three major \\nreforms. First, the presentation of the Budget has been advanced to 1st \\nFebruary to enable the Parliament to avoid a Vote on Account and pass a \\nsingle Appropriation Bill for 2017-18, before the close of the current \\nfinancial year. This would enable the Ministries and Departments to \\noperationalise all schemes and projects, including the new schemes, right \\nfrom the commencement of the next financial year. They would be able to \\nfully utilise the available working season before the onset of the monsoon. \\nSecond, the merger of the Railways Budget with the General Budget is a \\nhistoric step. We have discontinued the colonial practice prevalent since \\n1924. This decision brings the Railways to the centre stage of Government’s \\nfiscal policy and would facilitate multi modal transport planning between \\nrailways, highways and inland waterways. The functional autonomy of \\nRailways will, however, continue. Third, we have done away with the plan \\nand non-plan classification of expenditure. This will give us a holistic view \\nof allocations for sectors and ministries. This would facilitate optimal \\nallocation of resources. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n19. Madam Speaker, we are aware that we need to do more for our \\npeople. Continuing with the task of fulfilling the people’s expectations, our \\nagenda for the next year is : “Transform, Energise and Clean India”, that is, \\nTEC India. This agenda of TEC India seeks to \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n. Transform the quality of governance and quality of life of our \\npeople; \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n. Energise various sections of society, especially the youth and \\nthe vulnerable, and enable them to unleash their true \\npotential; and \\n. Clean the country from the evils of corruption, black money \\nand non-transparent political funding. \\n\\n\\nI propose to present my Budget proposals under ten distinct themes to \\nfoster this broad agenda. The themes are : \\n\\n(i) Farmers : for whom we have committed to double the income \\nin 5 years; \\n(ii) Rural Population : providing employment and basic \\ninfrastructure; \\n(iii) Youth : energising them through education, skills and jobs; \\n(iv) Poor and the Underprivileged : strengthening the systems of \\nsocial security, health care and affordable housing; \\n(v) Infrastructure: for efficiency, productivity and quality of life; \\n(vi) Financial Sector : growth and stability through stronger \\ninstitutions; \\n(vii) Digital Economy : for speed, accountability and transparency; \\n(viii) Public Service : effective governance and efficient service \\ndelivery through people’s participation; \\n(ix) Prudent Fiscal Management : to ensure optimal deployment \\nof resources and preserve fiscal stability; and \\n(x) Tax Administration : honouring the honest. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nI. FARMERS \\n20. The Indian farmer has once again shown his commitment and \\nresilience in the current year. The total area sown under kharif and rabi \\nseasons are higher than the previous year. With a better monsoon, \\nagriculture is expected to grow at 4.1% in the current year. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n21. In last year’s Budget speech, I focused on ‘income security’ of \\nfarmers to double their income in 5 years. I had also announced a number \\nof measures. We have to take more steps and enable the farmers to \\nincrease their production and productivity; and to deal with post-harvest \\nchallenges. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\n22. For a good crop, adequate credit should be available to farmers in \\ntime. The target for agricultural credit in 2017-18 has been fixed at a record \\nlevel of ` 10 lakh crores. We will take special efforts to ensure adequate \\nflow of credit to the under serviced areas, the Eastern States and Jammu & \\nKashmir. The farmers will also benefit from 60 days’ interest waiver \\nannounced by Honourable Prime Minister in respect of their loans from the \\ncooperative credit structure. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n23. About 40% of the small and marginal farmers avail credit from the \\ncooperative structure. The Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) act \\nas the front end for loan disbursements. We will support NABARD for \\ncomputerisation and integration of all 63,000 functional PACS with the Core \\nBanking System of District Central Cooperative Banks. This will be done in 3 \\nyears at an estimated cost of ` 1,900 crores, with financial participation \\nfrom State Governments. This will ensure seamless flow of credit to small \\nand marginal farmers. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n24. At the time of sowing, farmers should feel secure against natural \\ncalamities. The Fasal Bima Yojana launched by our Government is a major \\nstep in this direction. The coverage of this scheme will be increased from \\n30% of cropped area in 2016-17 to 40% in 2017-18 and 50% in 2018-19. \\nThe Budget provision of ` 5,500 crores for this Yojana in BE 2016-17 was \\nincreased to ` 13,240 crores in RE 2016-17 to settle the arrear claims. For \\n2017-18, I have provided a sum of ` 9,000 crores. The sum insured under \\nthis Yojana has more than doubled from ` 69,000 crores in Kharif 2015 to \\n` 1,41,625 crores in Kharif 2016. \\n25. Issuance of Soil Health Cards has gathered momentum. The real \\nbenefit to farmers would be available only when the soil samples are tested \\nquickly and nutrient level of the soil is known. Government will therefore \\nset up new mini labs in Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and ensure 100% \\ncoverage of all 648 KVKs in the country. In addition, 1000 mini labs will be \\nset up by qualified local entrepreneurs. Government will provide credit \\nlinked subsidy to these entrepreneurs. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n26. A Long Term Irrigation Fund has already been set up in NABARD. \\nHonourable Prime Minister has announced an addition of ` 20,000 crores to \\nits corpus. This will take the total corpus of this Fund to ` 40,000 crores. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n27. A dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund will be set up in NABARD to \\nachieve the goal, ‘per drop more crop’. The Fund will have an initial corpus \\nof `5,000 crores. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\n28. For the post-harvest phase, we will take steps to enable farmers to \\nget better prices for their produce in the markets. The coverage of National \\nAgricultural Market (e-NAM) will be expanded from the current 250 \\nmarkets to 585 APMCs. Assistance up to a ceiling of ` 75 lakhs will be \\nprovided to every e-NAM market for establishment of cleaning, grading and \\npackaging facilities. This will lead to value addition of farmers’ produce. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n29. Market reforms will be undertaken and the States would be urged to \\ndenotify perishables from APMC. This will give opportunity to farmers to \\nsell their produce and get better prices. \\n30. We also propose to integrate farmers who grow fruits and \\nvegetables with agro processing units for better price realisation and \\nreduction of post-harvest losses. A model law on contract farming would \\ntherefore be prepared and circulated among the States for adoption. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n31. Dairy is an important source of additional income for the farmers. \\nAvailability of milk processing facility and other infrastructure will benefit \\nthe farmers through value addition. A large number of milk processing \\nunits set up under the Operation Flood Programme has since become old \\nand obsolete. A Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund \\nwould be set up in NABARD with a corpus of ` 8,000 crores over 3 years. \\nInitially, the Fund will start with a corpus of ` 2,000 crores. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nII. RURAL POPULATION \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n32. I now turn to the Rural Sector, which was so dear to the heart of \\nMahatma Gandhi. \\n33. Over ` 3 lakh crores are spent in rural areas every year, if we add up \\nall the programmes meant for rural poor from the Central Budget, State \\nBudgets, Bank linkage for self-help groups, etc. With a clear focus on \\nimproving accountability, outcomes and convergence, we will undertake a \\nMission Antyodaya to bring one crore households out of poverty and to \\nmake 50,000 gram panchayats poverty free by 2019, the 150th birth \\nanniversary of Gandhiji. We will utilise the existing resources more \\neffectively along with annual increases. This mission will work with a \\nfocused micro plan for sustainable livelihood for every deprived household. \\nA composite index for poverty free gram panchayats would be developed to \\nmonitor the progress from the baseline. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\n34. Our Government has made a conscious effort to reorient MGNREGA \\nto support our resolve to double farmers’ income. While providing at least \\n100 days employment to every rural household, MGNREGA should create \\nproductive assets to improve farm productivity and incomes. The target of \\n5 lakh farm ponds and 10 lakh compost pits announced in the last Budget \\nfrom MGNREGA funds will be fully achieved. In fact, against 5 lakh farm \\nponds, it is expected that about 10 lakh farm ponds would be completed by \\nMarch 2017. During 2017-18, another 5 lakh farm ponds will be taken up. \\nThis single measure will contribute greatly to drought proofing of gram \\npanchayats. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n35. Participation of women in MGNREGA has increased to 55% from \\nless than 48% in the past. \\n36. Honourable Members would be happy to note that the budget \\nprovision of `38,500 crores under MGNREGA in 2016-17 has been increased \\nto `48,000 crores in 2017-18. This is the highest ever allocation for \\nMGNREGA. The initiative to geo-tag all MGNREGA assets and putting them \\nin public domain has established greater transparency. We are also using \\nspace technology in a big way to plan MGNREGA works. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n37. The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is now being \\nimplemented as never before. The pace of construction of PMGSY roads \\nhas accelerated to reach 133 km roads per day in 2016-17, as against an \\naverage of 73 km during the period 2011-2014. We have also taken up the \\ntask of connecting habitations with more than 100 persons in left wing \\nextremism affected Blocks. We have committed to complete the current \\ntarget under PMGSY by 2019. I have provided a sum of ` 19,000 crores in \\n2017-18 for this scheme. Together with the contribution of States, an \\namount of ` 27,000 crores will be spent on PMGSY in 2017-18. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n38. We propose to complete 1 crore houses by 2019 for the \\nhouseless and those living in kutcha houses. I have stepped up the \\nallocation for Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin from ` 15,000 crores \\nin BE 2016-17 to ` 23,000 crores in 2017-18. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n39. We are well on our way to achieving 100% village electrification by \\n1st May 2018. An increased allocation of ` 4,814 crores has been proposed \\nunder the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana in 2017-18. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n40. I have also proposed to increase the allocations for Deendayal \\nAntyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission for promotion of skill \\ndevelopment and livelihood opportunities for people in rural areas to \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n`4,500 in 2017-18. The allocation for Prime Minister's Employment \\nGeneration Programme (PMEGP) and credit support schemes has been \\nincreased more than 3 times. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n41. Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) has made tremendous progress in \\npromoting safe sanitation and ending open defecation. Sanitation coverage \\nin rural India has gone up from 42% in October 2014 to about 60%. Open \\nDefecation Free villages are now being given priority for piped water supply. \\n42. We propose to provide safe drinking water to over 28,000 arsenic \\nand fluoride affected habitations in the next four years. This will be a sub \\nmission of the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). \\n43. For imparting new skills to the people in the rural areas, mason \\ntraining will be provided to 5 lakh persons by 2022, with an immediate \\ntarget of training at least 20,000 persons by 2017-18. \\n44. Panchayati raj institutions still lack human resources for \\nimplementing development programmes. A programme of “human \\nresource reforms for results” will be launched during 2017-18 for this \\npurpose. \\n45. The Government will continue to work closely with the farmers and \\nthe people in the rural areas to improve their life and environment. This is a \\nnon-negotiable agenda for our Government. The total allocation for the \\nrural, agriculture and allied sectors in 2017-18 is ` 1,87,223 crores, which is \\n24% higher than the previous year. \\n\\n\\nIII. YOUTH \\n\\n46. Let me now focus on my proposals for the youth. \\n47. Quality education will energise our youth. In the words of Swami \\nVivekananda, “The education which does not help the common mass of \\npeople to equip themselves for the struggle for life ………… is it worth the \\nname?” \\n48. We have proposed to introduce a system of measuring annual \\nlearning outcomes in our schools. Emphasis will be given on science \\neducation and flexibility in curriculum to promote creativity through local \\ninnovative content. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n49. An Innovation Fund for Secondary Education will be created to \\nencourage local innovation for ensuring universal access, gender parity and \\nquality improvement. This will include ICT enabled learning transformation. \\nThe focus will be on 3479 educationally backward blocks. \\n50. In higher education, we will undertake reforms in the UGC. Good \\nquality institutions would be enabled to have greater administrative and \\nacademic autonomy. Colleges will be identified based on accreditation and \\nranking, and given autonomous status. A revised framework will be put in \\nplace for outcome based accreditation and credit based programmes. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n51. We propose to leverage information technology and launch \\nSWAYAM platform with at least 350 online courses. This would enable \\nstudents to virtually attend the courses taught by the best faculty; access \\nhigh quality reading resources; participate in discussion forums; take tests \\nand earn academic grades. Access to SWAYAM would be widened by \\nlinkage with DTH channels, dedicated to education. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n52. We propose to establish a National Testing Agency as an \\nautonomous and self-sustained premier testing organisation to conduct all \\nentrance examinations for higher education institutions. This would free \\nCBSE, AICTE and other premier institutions from these administrative \\nresponsibilities so that they can focus more on academics. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n53. We have a huge demographic advantage. Skill India mission was \\nlaunched in July 2015 to maximise the potential of our youth. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n54. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKK) have already been \\npromoted in more than 60 districts. We now propose to extend these \\nKendras to more than 600 districts across the country. 100 India \\nInternational Skills Centres will be established across the country. These \\nCentres would offer advanced training and also courses in foreign \\nlanguages. This will help those of our youth who seek job opportunities \\noutside the country. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n55. In 2017-18, we also propose to launch the Skill Acquisition and \\nKnowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion programme (SANKALP) at a \\ncost of ` 4,000 crores. SANKALP will provide market relevant training to 3.5 \\ncrore youth. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n \\n\\n56. The next phase of Skill Strengthening for Industrial Value \\nEnhancement (STRIVE) will also be launched in 2017-18 at a cost of ` 2,200 \\ncrores. STRIVE will focus on improving the quality and market relevance of \\nvocational training provided in ITIs and strengthen the apprenticeship \\nprogrammes through industry cluster approach. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n57. A special scheme for creating employment in the textile sector has \\nalready been launched. A similar scheme will be implemented for the \\nleather and footwear industries. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n58. Tourism is a big employment generator and has a multiplier impact \\non the economy. Five Special Tourism Zones, anchored on SPVs, will be set \\nup in partnership with the States. Incredible India 2.0 Campaign will be \\nlaunched across the world. \\n\\n\\nIV. THE POOR AND THE UNDERPRIVILEGED \\n\\n59. Madam Speaker, I now turn to my proposals for the poor and the \\nunderprivileged. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n60. Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas begins with the girl child and women. \\nMahila Shakti Kendra will be set up at village level with an allocation of \\n` 500 crores in 14 lakh ICDS Anganwadi Centres. This will provide one stop \\nconvergent support services for empowering rural women with \\nopportunities for skill development, employment, digital literacy, health \\nand nutrition. A nationwide scheme for financial assistance to pregnant \\nwomen has already been announced by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st \\nDecember, 2016. Under this scheme, ` 6,000 each will be transferred \\ndirectly to the bank accounts of pregnant women who undergo institutional \\ndelivery and vaccinate their children. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n61. For the welfare of Women and Children under various schemes \\nacross all Ministries, I have stepped up the allocation from ` 1,56,528 crores \\nin BE 2016-17 to ` 1,84,632 crores in 2017-18. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n62. We propose to facilitate higher investment in affordable housing. \\nAffordable housing will now be given infrastructure status, which will \\nenable these projects to avail the associated benefits. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\n63. The National Housing Bank will refinance individual housing loans of \\nabout ` 20,000 crore in 2017-18. Thanks to the surplus liquidity created by \\ndemonetisation, the Banks have already started reducing their lending \\nrates, including those for housing. In addition, interest subvention for \\nhousing loans has also been announced by the Honourable Prime Minister. \\n64. Poverty is usually associated with poor health. It is the poor who \\nsuffer the maximum from various chronic diseases. Government has \\ntherefore prepared an action plan to eliminate Kala-Azar and Filariasis by \\n2017, Leprosy by 2018 and Measles by 2020. Elimination of tuberculosis by \\n2025 is also targeted. Similarly, action plan has been prepared to reduce \\nIMR from 39 in 2014 to 28 by 2019 and MMR from 167 in 2011-13 to 100 \\nby 2018-2020. 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres will be transformed into Health \\nand Wellness Centres. \\n65. We need to ensure adequate availability of specialist doctors to \\nstrengthen Secondary and Tertiary levels of health care. We have therefore \\ndecided to take steps to create additional 5,000 Post Graduate seats per \\nannum. In addition, steps will be taken to roll out DNB courses in big \\nDistrict Hospitals; strengthen PG teaching in select ESI and Municipal \\nCorporation Hospitals; and encourage reputed Private Hospitals to start \\nDNB courses. We will work with the State Governments to take these tasks \\nforward. The Government is committed to take necessary steps for \\nstructural transformation of the Regulatory framework of Medical \\nEducation and Practice in India. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n66. Two new All India Institutes of Medical Sciences will be set up in the \\nStates of Jharkhand and Gujarat. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n67. We propose to amend the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules to ensure \\navailability of drugs at reasonable prices and promote use of generic \\nmedicines. New rules for regulating medical devices will also be formulated. \\nThese rules will be internationally harmonised and attract investment into \\nthis sector. This will reduce the cost of such devices. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n68. We are keen on fostering a conducive labour environment wherein \\nlabour rights are protected and harmonious labour relations lead to higher \\nproductivity. Legislative reforms will be undertaken to simplify, rationalise \\nand amalgamate the existing labour laws into 4 Codes on (i) wages; (ii) \\nindustrial relations; (iii) social security and welfare; and (iv) safety and \\nworking conditions. The Model Shops and Establishment Bill 2016 has been \\ncirculated to all States for consideration and adoption. This would open up \\nadditional avenues for employment of women. The amendment made to \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nthe Payment of Wages Act, is another initiative of our Government for the \\nbenefit of the labour and ease of doing business. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n69. Our Government is giving special importance to implementation of \\nthe schemes for welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and \\nMinorities. The allocation for the welfare of Scheduled Castes has been \\nstepped up from `38,833 crores in BE 2016-17 to ` 52,393 crores in \\n2017-18, representing an increase of about 35%. The allocation for \\nScheduled Tribes has been increased to `31,920 crores and for Minority \\nAffairs to `4,195 crores. The Government will introduce outcome based \\nmonitoring of expenditure in these sectors by the NITI Aayog. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n70. For senior citizens, Aadhar based Smart Cards containing their \\nhealth details will be introduced. A beginning will be made through a pilot \\nin 15 districts during 2017-18. The LIC will implement a scheme for senior \\ncitizens to provide assured pension, with a guaranteed return of 8% per \\nannum for 10 years. \\n\\n\\nV. INFRASTRUCTURE \\n\\n71. The fifth component of TEC India agenda is Infrastructure. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n72. Railways, roads and rivers are the lifeline of our country. I feel \\nprivileged to present the first combined Budget of independent India that \\nincludes the Railways also. We are now in a position to synergise the \\ninvestments in railways, roads, waterways and civil aviation. For 2017-18, \\nthe total capital and development expenditure of Railways has been pegged \\nat ` 1,31,000 crores. This includes ` 55,000 crores provided by the \\nGovernment. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n73. Among other things, the Railways will focus on four major areas, \\nnamely : \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n(i) Passenger safety; \\n(ii) Capital and development works; \\n(iii) Cleanliness; and \\n(iv) Finance and accounting reforms. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n74. For passenger safety, a Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh will be created \\nwith a corpus of ` 1 lakh crores over a period of 5 years. Besides seed \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ncapital from the Government, the Railways will arrange the balance \\nresources from their own revenues and other sources. Government will lay \\ndown clear cut guidelines and timeline for implementing various safety \\nworks to be funded from this Kosh. Unmanned level crossings on Broad \\nGauge lines will be eliminated by 2020. Expert international assistance will \\nbe harnessed to improve safety preparedness and maintenance practices. \\n75. In the next 3 years, the throughput is proposed to be enhanced by \\n10%. This will be done through modernisation and upgradation of \\nidentified corridors. Railway lines of 3,500 kms will be commissioned in \\n2017-18, as against 2,800 kms in 2016-17. Steps will be taken to launch \\ndedicated trains for tourism and pilgrimage. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n76. Railways have set up joint ventures with 9 State Governments. 70 \\nprojects have been identified for construction and development. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n77. A beginning has been made with regard to station redevelopment. \\nAt least 25 stations are expected to be awarded during 2017-18 for station \\nredevelopment. 500 stations will be made differently abled friendly by \\nproviding lifts and escalators. \\n78. It is proposed to feed about 7,000 stations with solar power in the \\nmedium term. A beginning has already been made in 300 stations. Works \\nwill be taken up for 2,000 railway stations as part of 1000 MW solar \\nmission. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n79. Our focus is on swachh rail. SMS based Clean My Coach Service has \\nbeen started. It is now proposed to introduce ‘Coach Mitra’ facility, a single \\nwindow interface, to register all coach related complaints and \\nrequirements. By 2019, all coaches of Indian Railways will be fitted with bio \\ntoilets. Pilot plants for environment friendly disposal of solid waste and \\nconversion of biodegradable waste to energy are being set up at New Delhi \\nand Jaipur railway stations. Five more such solid waste management plants \\nare now being taken up. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n80. Today Indian Railways face stiff competition from other modes of \\ntransportation which are dominated by the private sector. Transformative \\nmeasures have to be undertaken to make Indian Railways competitive to \\nretain their position of pre-eminence. The following steps will therefore be \\ntaken : \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n(i) Railways will implement end to end integrated transport \\nsolutions for select commodities through partnership with \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nlogistics players, who would provide both front and back end \\nconnectivity. Rolling stocks and practices will be customised to \\ntransport perishable goods, especially agricultural products. \\n(ii) Railways will offer competitive ticket booking facility to the \\npublic at large. Service charge on e-tickets booked through IRCTC \\nhas been withdrawn. Cashless reservations have gone up from \\n58% to 68%. \\n(iii) As part of accounting reforms, accrual based financial \\nstatements will be rolled out by March 2019. \\n81. It will be our continuous endeavour to improve the Operating Ratio \\nof the Railways. The tariffs of Railways would be fixed, taking into \\nconsideration costs, quality of service, social obligations and competition \\nfrom other forms of transport. \\n82. Metro rail is emerging as an important mode of urban \\ntransportation. A new Metro Rail Policy will be announced with focus on \\ninnovative models of implementation and financing, as well as \\nstandardisation and indigenisation of hardware and software. This will \\nopen up new job opportunities for our youth. \\n83. A new Metro Rail Act will be enacted by rationalising the existing \\nlaws. This will facilitate greater private participation and investment in \\nconstruction and operation. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n84. In the road sector, I have stepped up the Budget allocation for \\nhighways from ` 57,976 crores in BE 2016-17 to ` 64,900 crores in 2017-18. \\n2,000 kms of coastal connectivity roads have been identified for \\nconstruction and development. This will facilitate better connectivity with \\nports and remote villages. The total length of roads, including those under \\nPMGSY, built from 2014-15 till the current year is about 1,40,000 kms which \\nis significantly higher than previous three years. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n85. An effective multi modal logistics and transport sector will make our \\neconomy more competitive. A specific programme for development of \\nmulti-modal logistics parks, together with multi modal transport facilities, \\nwill be drawn up and implemented. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n86. Select airports in Tier 2 cities will be taken up for operation and \\nmaintenance in the PPP mode. Airport Authority of India Act will be \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\namended to enable effective monetisation of land assets. The resources, so \\nraised, will be utilised for airport upgradation. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n87. For transportation sector as a whole, including rail, roads, shipping, I \\nhave provided ` 2,41,387 crores in 2017-18. This magnitude of investment \\nwill spur a huge amount of economic activity across the country and create \\nmore job opportunities. \\n88. Telecom sector is an important component of our infrastructure eco \\nsystem. The recent spectrum auctions have removed spectrum scarcity in \\nthe country. This will give a major fillip to mobile broadband and Digital \\nIndia for the benefit of people living in rural and remote areas. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n89. Under the BharatNet Project, OFC has been laid in 1,55,000 kms. I \\nhave stepped up the allocation for BharatNet Project to ` 10,000 crores in \\n2017-18. By the end of 2017-18, high speed broadband connectivity on \\noptical fibre will be available in more than 1,50,000 gram panchayats, with \\nwifi hot spots and access to digital services at low tariffs. A DigiGaon \\ninitiative will be launched to provide tele-medicine, education and skills \\nthrough digital technology. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n90. For strengthening our Energy sector, Government has decided to set \\nup Strategic Crude Oil Reserves. In the first phase, 3 such Reserves facilities \\nhave been set up. Now in the second phase, it is proposed to set up caverns \\nat 2 more locations, namely, Chandikhole in Odisha and Bikaner in \\nRajasthan. This will take our strategic reserve capacity to 15.33 MMT. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n91. In solar energy, we now propose to take up the second phase of \\nSolar Park development for additional 20,000 MW capacity. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n92. We are also creating an eco-system to make India a global hub for \\nelectronics manufacturing. Over 250 investment proposals for electronics \\nmanufacturing have been received in the last 2 years, totalling an \\ninvestment of ` 1.26 lakh crores. A number of global leaders and mobile \\nmanufacturers have set up production facilities in India. I have therefore \\nexponentially increased the allocation for incentive schemes like M-SIPS and \\nEDF to ` 745 crores in 2017-18. This is an all-time high. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n93. We have to focus on our export infrastructure in a competitive \\nworld. A new and restructured Central scheme, namely, Trade \\nInfrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) will be launched in 2017-18. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\n94. The total allocation for infrastructure development in 2017-18 \\nstands at `3,96,135 crores. \\n\\n\\nVI. FINANCIAL SECTOR \\n\\n95. I now turn to the Financial Sector. The focus of TEC India agenda in \\nthis sector is on building stable and stronger institutions. We will continue \\nwith our reform agenda with several new measures. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n96. Our Government has already undertaken substantive reforms in FDI \\npolicy in the last two years. More than 90% of the total FDI inflows are now \\nthrough the automatic route. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board \\n(FIPB) has successfully implemented e-filing and online processing of FDI \\napplications. We have now reached a stage where FIPB can be phased out. \\nWe have therefore decided to abolish the FIPB in 2017-18. A roadmap for \\nthe same will be announced in the next few months. In the meantime, \\nfurther liberalisation of FDI policy is under consideration and necessary \\nannouncements will be made in due course. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n97. The Commodities markets require further reforms for the benefits of \\nfarmers. An expert committee will be constituted to study and promote \\ncreation of an operational and legal framework to integrate spot market \\nand derivatives market for commodities trading. e-NAM would be an \\nintegral part of such framework. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n98. The draft bill to curtail the menace of illicit deposit schemes has \\nbeen placed in the public domain and will be introduced shortly after its \\nfinalisation. There is an urgent need to protect the poor and gullible \\ninvestors from another set of dubious schemes, operated by unscrupulous \\nentities who exploit the regulatory gaps in the Multi State Cooperative \\nSocieties Act, 2002. We will amend this Act in consultation with various \\nstakeholders, as part of our ‘Clean India’ agenda. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n99. The bill relating to resolution of financial firms will be introduced in \\nthe current Budget Session of Parliament. This will contribute to stability \\nand resilience of our financial system. It will also protect the consumers of \\nvarious financial institutions. Together with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy \\nCode, a resolution mechanism for financial firms will ensure \\ncomprehensiveness of the resolution system in our country. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n100. I had stated in my last Budget speech that a Bill will be introduced to \\nstreamline institutional arrangements for resolution of disputes in \\ninfrastructure related construction contracts, PPP and public utility \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ncontracts. After extensive stakeholders’ consultations, we have decided \\nthat the required mechanism would be instituted as part of the Arbitration \\nand Conciliation Act 1996. An amendment Bill will be introduced in this \\nregard. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n101. Cyber security is critical for safeguarding the integrity and stability of \\nour financial sector. A Computer Emergency Response Team for our \\nFinancial Sector (CERT-Fin) will be established. This entity will work in close \\ncoordination with all financial sector regulators and other stakeholders. \\n102. I have also proposed several other measures in the financial sector \\nwhich are listed in Annex I. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n103. Listing of Public Sector enterprises will foster greater public \\naccountability and unlock the true value of these companies. The \\nGovernment will put in place a revised mechanism and procedure to ensure \\ntime bound listing of identified CPSEs on stock exchanges. The \\ndisinvestment policy announced by me in the last budget will continue. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n104. The shares of Railway PSEs like IRCTC, IRFC and IRCON will be listed \\nin stock exchanges. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n105. We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs through \\nconsolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can \\nbe integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them \\ncapacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher \\ninvestment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. \\nPossibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector. We \\npropose to create an integrated public sector ‘oil major’ which will be able \\nto match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil \\nand gas companies. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n106. Our ETF, comprising shares of ten CPSEs, has received overwhelming \\nresponse in the recent Further Fund Offering (FFO). We will continue to use \\nETF as a vehicle for further disinvestment of shares. Accordingly, a new ETF \\nwith diversified CPSE stocks and other Government holdings will be \\nlaunched in 2017-18. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n107. The focus on resolution of stressed legacy accounts of Banks \\ncontinues. The legal framework has been strengthened to facilitate \\nresolution, through the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code \\nand the amendments to the SARFAESI and Debt Recovery Tribunal Acts. In \\nline with the ‘Indradhanush’ roadmap, I have provided ` 10,000 crores for \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nrecapitalisation of Banks in 2017-18. Additional allocation will be provided, \\nas may be required. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n108. Listing and trading of Security Receipts issued by a securitization \\ncompany or a reconstruction company under the SARFAESI Act will be \\npermitted in SEBI registered stock exchanges. This will enhance capital flows \\ninto the securitization industry and will particularly be helpful to deal with \\nbank NPAs. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n109. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana has contributed significantly to \\nfunding the unfunded and the underfunded. Last year, the target of ` 1.22 \\nlakh crores was exceeded. For 2017-18, I propose to double the lending \\ntarget of 2015-16 and set it at ` 2.44 lakh crores. Priority will be given to \\nDalits, Tribals, Backward Classes, Minorities and Women. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n110. The Stand Up India scheme was launched by our Government in \\nApril 2016 to support Dalit, Tribal and Women entrepreneurs to set up \\ngreenfield enterprises and become job creators. Over 16,000 new \\nenterprises have come up through this scheme in activities, as diverse as \\nfood processing, garments, diagnostic centres, etc. \\n\\n\\nVII. DIGITAL ECONOMY \\n\\n111. Promotion of a digital economy is an integral part of Government’s \\nstrategy to clean the system and weed out corruption and black money. It \\nhas a transformative impact in terms of greater formalisation of the \\neconomy and mainstreaming of financial savings into the banking system. \\nThis, in turn, is expected to energise private investment in the country \\nthrough lower cost of credit. India is now on the cusp of a massive digital \\nrevolution. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n112. A shift to digital payments has huge benefits for the common man. \\nThe earlier initiative of our Government to promote financial inclusion and \\nthe JAM trinity were important precursors to our current push for digital \\ntransactions. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n113. Already there is evidence of increased digital transactions. The \\nBHIM app has been launched. It will unleash the power of mobile phones \\nfor digital payments and financial inclusion. 125 lakh people have adopted \\nthe BHIM app so far. The Government will launch two new schemes to \\npromote the usage of BHIM; these are, Referral Bonus Scheme for \\nindividuals and a Cashback Scheme for merchants. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n \\n\\n114. Aadhar Pay, a merchant version of Aadhar Enabled Payment System, \\nwill be launched shortly. This will be specifically beneficial for those who do \\nnot have debit cards, mobile wallets and mobile phones. A Mission will be \\nset up with a target of 2,500 crore digital transactions for 2017-18 through \\nUPI, USSD, Aadhar Pay, IMPS and debit cards. Banks have targeted to \\nintroduce additional 10 lakh new PoS terminals by March 2017. They will \\nbe encouraged to introduce 20 lakh Aadhar based PoS by September 2017. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n115. Increased digital transactions will enable small and micro enterprises \\nto access formal credit. Government will encourage SIDBI to refinance \\ncredit institutions which provide unsecured loans, at reasonable interest \\nrates, to borrowers based on their transaction history. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n116. The digital payment infrastructure and grievance handling \\nmechanisms shall be strengthened. The focus would be on rural and semi \\nurban areas through Post Offices, Fair Price Shops and Banking \\nCorrespondents. Steps would be taken to promote and possibly mandate \\npetrol pumps, fertilizer depots, municipalities, Block offices, road transport \\noffices, universities, colleges, hospitals and other institutions to have \\nfacilities for digital payments, including BHIM App. A proposal to mandate \\nall Government receipts through digital means, beyond a prescribed limit, is \\nunder consideration. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n117. Government will strengthen the Financial Inclusion Fund to augment \\nresources for taking up these initiatives. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n118. Government will consider and work with various stakeholders for \\nearly implementation of the interim recommendations of the Committee of \\nChief Ministers on digital transactions. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n119. The Committee on Digital Payments constituted by Department of \\nEconomic Affairs has recommended structural reforms in the payment eco \\nsystem, including amendments to the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, \\n2007. Government will undertake a comprehensive review of this Act and \\nbring about appropriate amendments. To begin with, it is proposed to \\ncreate a Payments Regulatory Board in the Reserve Bank of India by \\nreplacing the existing Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and \\nSettlement Systems. Necessary amendments are proposed to this effect in \\nthe Finance Bill 2017. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n120. As we move faster on the path of digital transactions and cheque \\npayments, we need to ensure that the payees of dishonoured cheques are \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nable to realise the payments. Government is therefore considering the \\noption of amending the Negotiable Instruments Act suitably. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nVIII. PUBLIC SERVICE \\n\\n121. I now turn to Public Service. Our focus here is on effective \\ngovernment and efficient service delivery. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n122. We have made a strong beginning with regard to Direct Benefit \\nTransfer (DBT) to LPG and kerosene consumers. Chandigarh and eight \\ndistricts of Haryana have become kerosene free. 84 Government schemes \\nhave also boarded on the DBT platform. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n123. The Government e-market place which is now functional for \\nprocurement of goods and services, has been selected as one of the \\nwinners of the South Asia Procurement Innovation Awards of the World \\nBank. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n124. Our citizens in far flung regions of the country find it difficult to \\nobtain passports and redress passport related grievances. We have decided \\nto utilise the Head Post Offices as front offices for rendering passport \\nservices. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n125. Our defence forces keep the country safe from both external and \\ninternal threats. A Centralised Defence Travel System has now been \\ndeveloped through which travel tickets can be booked online by our \\nsoldiers and officers. They do not have to face the hassle of standing in \\nqueues with railway warrants. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n126. A comprehensive web based interactive Pension Disbursement \\nSystem for Defence Pensioners will be established. This system will receive \\npension proposals and make payments centrally. This will reduce the \\ngrievances of defence pensioners. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n127. At present our citizens, especially those belonging to the poor and \\nunprivileged sections, go through cumbersome procedures of Government \\nrecruitment. There are multiplicity of agencies and examinations. We \\npropose to introduce a system of single registration and two tier system of \\nexamination. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\n128. Over the years, the number of tribunals have multiplied with \\noverlapping functions. We propose to rationalise the number of tribunals \\nand merge tribunals wherever appropriate. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n129. In the recent past, there have been instances of big time offenders, \\nincluding economic offenders, fleeing the country to escape the reach of \\nlaw. We have to ensure that the law is allowed to take its own course. \\nGovernment is therefore considering introduction of legislative changes, or \\neven a new law, to confiscate the assets of such persons located within the \\ncountry, till they submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal forum. \\nNeedless to say that all necessary constitutional safeguards will be followed \\nin such cases. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n130. Our Government will continue to remain committed to improve the \\nstandards of public service and transparent governance. Service to the \\npeople was the life-long commitment of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma \\nGandhi. As we approach, the 150th Birth Anniversary of the Mahatma, we \\nwill take all steps to celebrate it in a befitting manner. A High Level \\nCommittee under the Chairmanship of Honourable Prime Minister is \\nproposed to be set up for the same. We will also commemorate the \\ncentenary year of Champaran Satyagrah this year. Government of India will \\nsupport Government of Gujarat to commemorate 100 years of Sabarmati \\nAshram in 2017, in a befitting manner. 200 years ago in 1817, a valiant \\nuprising of soldiers led by Buxi Jagabandhu took place in Khordha of \\nOdisha. We will commemorate the same appropriately. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIX. PRUDENT FISCAL MANAGEMENT \\n\\n131. I now turn to the fiscal situation in the context of the Budget for \\n2017-18. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n132. The total expenditure in Budget for 2017-18 has been placed at \\n`21.47 lakh crores. With the abolition of Plan-Non Plan classification of \\nexpenditure, the focus is now on Revenue and Capital expenditure. I have \\nstepped up the allocation for Capital expenditure by 25.4% over the \\nprevious year. This will have multiplier effects and lead to higher growth. \\nThe total resources being transferred to the States and the Union Territories \\nwith Legislatures is ` 4.11 lakh crores, against ` 3.60 lakh crores in BE 2016-\\n17. Details of allocations for important sectors and schemes and transfer of \\nresources to States are given in Annex II of my Speech. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n133. I have made a provision of ` 3,000 crores under the Department of \\nEconomic Affairs to implement various Budget announcements and other \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nnew schemes in 2017-18. For Defence expenditure excluding pensions, I \\nhave provided a sum of ` 2,74,114 crores including ` 86,488 crores for \\nDefence capital. I have increased the allocation for Scientific Ministries to \\n` 37,435 crore in 2017-18. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n134. For the first time, a consolidated Outcome Budget, covering all \\nMinistries and Departments, is being laid along with the other Budget \\ndocuments. This will improve accountability of Government expenditure. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n135. The FRBM Review Committee has given its report recently. The \\nCommittee has done an elaborate exercise and has recommended that a \\nsustainable debt path must be the principal macro-economic anchor of our \\nfiscal policy. The Committee has favoured Debt to GDP of 60% for the \\nGeneral Government by 2023, consisting of 40% for Central Government \\nand 20% for State Governments. Within this framework, the Committee \\nhas derived and recommended 3% fiscal deficit for the next three years. \\nThe Committee has also provided for ‘Escape Clauses’, for deviations upto \\n0.5% of GDP, from the stipulated fiscal deficit target. Among the triggers \\nfor taking recourse to these Escape Clauses, the Committee has included \\n“far-reaching structural reforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal \\nimplications” as one of the factors. Although there is a strong case now to \\ninvoke this Escape Clause, I am refraining from doing so. The Report of the \\nCommittee will be carefully examined and appropriate decisions taken in \\ndue course. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n136. Nevertheless, I take note of the fiscal deficit roadmap of 3% \\nrecommended by the Committee for the next three years. I have taken into \\nconsideration the need for higher public expenditure in the context of \\nsluggish private sector investment and slow global growth. I have kept in \\nmind the recommendation of the Committee that a sustainable debt should \\nbe the underlying basis of prudent fiscal management. Considering all \\nthese aspects, I have pegged the fiscal deficit for 2017-18 at 3.2% of GDP \\nand remain committed to achieve 3% in the following year. With this \\ngradual approach, I have ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation, without \\ncompromising the requirements of public investment. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n137. I have taken due care to limit the net market borrowing of \\nGovernment to ` 3.48 lakh crores after buyback, much lower than ` 4.25 \\nlakh crores of the previous year. More importantly, the Revenue Deficit of \\n2.3% in BE 2016-17 stands reduced to 2.1% in the Revised Estimates. The \\nRevenue Deficit for next year is pegged at 1.9% , against 2% mandated by \\nthe FRBM Act. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\n138. It will be our endeavour to improve upon these fiscal numbers, \\nespecially the fiscal deficit, in the next year, through greater focus on \\nquality of expenditure and higher tax realisation from the huge cash \\ndeposits in Banks, triggered by demonetisation. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\nPART B \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\n139. I shall now present my tax proposals: \\n\\n140. India’s tax to GDP ratio is very low, and the proportion of direct tax \\nto indirect tax is not optimal from the view point of social justice. I place \\nbefore you certain data to indicate that our direct tax collection is not \\ncommensurate with the income and consumption pattern of Indian \\neconomy. As against estimated 4.2 crore persons engaged in organised \\nsector employment, the number of individuals filing return for salary \\nincome are only 1.74 crore. As against 5.6 crore informal sector individual \\nenterprises and firms doing small business in India, the number of returns \\nfiled by this category are only 1.81 crore. Out of the 13.94 lakh companies \\nregistered in India upto 31st March, 2014, 5.97 lakh companies have filed \\ntheir returns for Assessment Year 2016-17. Of the 5.97 lakh companies \\nwhich have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17 so far, as many \\nas 2.76 lakh companies have shown losses or zero income. 2.85 lakh \\ncompanies have shown profit before tax of less than ` 1 crore. 28,667 \\ncompanies have shown profit between ` 1 crore to ` 10 crore, and only \\n7781 companies have profit before tax of more than ` 10 crores. \\n\\n141. Among the 3.7 crore individuals who filed the tax returns in \\n2015-16, 99 lakh show income below the exemption limit of ` 2.5 lakh p.a., \\n1.95 crore show income between ` 2.5 to ` 5 lakh, 52 lakh show income \\nbetween ` 5 to ` 10 lakhs and only 24 lakh people show income above ` 10 \\nlakhs. Of the 76 lakh individual assesses who declare income above ` 5 \\nlakh, 56 lakh are in the salaried class. The number of people showing \\nincome more than ` 50 lakh in the entire country is only 1.72 lakh. We can \\ncontrast this with the fact that in the last five years, more than 1.25 crore \\ncars have been sold, and number of Indian citizens who flew abroad, either \\nfor business or tourism, is 2 crore in the year 2015. From all these figures \\nwe can conclude that we are largely a tax non-compliant society. The \\npredominance of cash in the economy makes it possible for the people to \\nevade their taxes. When too many people evade taxes, the burden of their \\nshare falls on those who are honest and compliant. \\n\\n142. After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received \\nin respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing \\npicture. During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits \\nbetween ` 2 lakh and ` 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts \\nwith an average deposit size of ` 5.03 lakh. Deposits of more than 80 lakh \\nwere made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of ` 3.31 crores. \\n\\n\\x0c\\nThis data mining will help us immensely in expanding the tax net as well as \\nincreasing the revenues, which was one of the objectives of \\ndemonetisation. \\n\\n143. Madam Speaker, one of the main priorities of our Government is to \\neliminate the black money component from the economy. We are \\ncommitted to make our taxation rates more reasonable, our tax \\nadministration more fair and expand the tax base in the country. This \\napproach will change the colour of money. \\n\\nxÉ<Ç nÖÉÊxÉªÉÉ cè, xÉªÉÉ nÉè® cè, xÉªÉÉÒ cè =àÉÆMÉ \\n\\nBÉÖEU lÉä {ÉcãÉä BÉäE iÉ®ÉÒBÉäE, iÉÉä cé BÉÖEU +ÉÉVÉ BÉäE fÆMÉ \\n\\n®Éä¶ÉxÉÉÒ +ÉÉBÉäE +ÉÆvÉä®Éå ºÉä VÉÉä ]BÉE®ÉªÉÉÒ cè \\n\\nBÉEÉãÉä vÉxÉ BÉEÉä £ÉÉÒ ¤ÉnãÉxÉÉ {É½É, +ÉÉVÉ +É{ÉxÉÉ ®ÆMÉ \\n\\n144. The net tax revenue of 2013-14 was ` 11.38 lakh crores. This grew \\nby 9.4% in 2014-15 and 17% in 2015-16. As per the RE of 2016-17, we will \\nend the year with a high growth rate of 17% for the second year in a row. \\nBecause of the serious efforts made by the Government, the rate of growth \\nof advance tax in personal income tax in the first three quarters of the \\ncurrent financial is 34.8%. \\n\\n145. Madam Speaker, the thrust of my tax proposals in this Budget is \\nstimulating growth, relief to middle class, affordable housing, curbing black \\nmoney, promoting digital economy, transparency of political funding and \\nsimplification of tax administration. \\n\\nMeasures for Promoting Affordable Housing and Real Estate Sector \\n\\n146. In my budget proposals last year, I had announced a scheme for \\nprofit-linked income tax exemption for promoters of affordable housing \\nscheme which has received a very good response. However, in order to \\nmake this scheme more attractive, I propose certain changes in the scheme. \\nFirst of all, instead of built up area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr., the carpet area of \\n30 and 60 sq.mtr. will be counted. Also the 30 sq.mtr. limit will apply only \\nin case of municipal limits of 4 metropolitan cities while for the rest of the \\ncountry including in the peripheral areas of metros, limit of 60 sq.mtr. will \\napply. In order to be eligible, the scheme was to be completed in 3 years \\nafter commencement. I propose to extend this period to 5 years. \\n\\n147. At present, the houses which are unoccupied after getting \\ncompletion certificates are subjected to tax on notional rental income. For \\nbuilders for whom constructed buildings are stock-in-trade, I propose to \\n\\n\\x0c\\napply this rule only after one year of the end of the year in which \\ncompletion certificate is received so that they get some breathing time for \\nliquidating their inventory. \\n\\n148. We also propose to make a number of changes in the capital gain \\ntaxation provisions in respect of land and building. The holding period for \\nconsidering gain from immovable property to be long term is 3 years now. \\nThis is proposed to be reduced to 2 years. Also, the base year for \\nindexation is proposed to be shifted from 1.4.1981 to 1.4.2001 for all \\nclasses of assets including immovable property. This move will significantly \\nreduce the capital gain tax liability while encouraging the mobility of assets. \\nWe also plan to extend the basket of financial instruments in which the \\ncapital gains can be invested without payment of tax. \\n\\n149. For Joint Development Agreement signed for development of \\nproperty, the liability to pay capital gain tax will arise in the year the project \\nis completed. \\n\\n150. The new capital for State of Andhra Pradesh is being constructed by \\ninnovative land-pooling mechanism without use of the Land Acquisition Act. \\nI propose to exempt from capital gain tax, persons holding land on 2.6.2014, \\nthe date on which the State of Andhra Pradesh was reorganised, and whose \\nland is being pooled for creation of capital city under the Government \\nscheme. \\n\\nMeasures for Stimulating Growth \\n\\n151. A concessional with-holding rate of 5% is being charged on interest \\nearned by foreign entities in external commercial borrowings or in bonds \\nand Government securities. This concession is available till 30.6.2017. I \\npropose to extend it to 30.6.2020. This benefit is also extended to Rupee \\nDenominated (Masala) Bonds. \\n\\n152. The Government gave income tax exemptions to start-ups with \\ncertain conditions last year. For the purpose of carry forward of losses in \\nrespect of such start-ups, the condition of continuous holding of 51% of \\nvoting rights has been relaxed subject to the condition that the holding of \\nthe original promoter/promoters continues. Also the profit linked \\ndeduction available to the start-ups for 3 years out of 5 years is being \\nchanged to 3 years out of 7 years. \\n\\n153. Minimum Alternate Tax is at present levied as an advance tax. There \\nis a strong demand for abolition of MAT. Although the plan for phasing out \\nof exemptions will kick in from 1.4.2017, the full benefit of revenue out of \\nphase-out will be available to Government only after 7 to 10 years when all \\n\\n\\x0c\\nthose who are already availing exemptions at present complete their period \\nof availment. Therefore, it is not practical to remove or reduce MAT at \\npresent. However, in order to allow companies to use MAT credit in future \\nyears, I propose to allow carry forward of MAT upto a period of 15 years \\ninstead of 10 years at present. \\n\\n154. In my Budget proposals in 2015, I had announced that I would be \\nbringing the corporate income tax rate down to 25% gradually. In 2016 \\nBudget, I had announced a reduction by 1% in case of those companies \\nwhose turnover is less than ` 5 crore. In the same Budget, I had also \\nannounced that new manufacturing companies who do not avail of any \\nexemption would be charged only 25% income tax. \\n\\n155. Medium and Small Enterprises occupy bulk of economic activities \\nand are also instrumental in providing maximum employment to people. \\nHowever, since they do not get many exemptions, they end up paying \\nmore taxes as compared to large companies. As per data of financial year \\n2015-16, 2.85 lakh companies making profit of less than ` 1 crore pay \\neffective tax rate of 30.26% while 298 companies making profit above ` 500 \\ncrores pay effective tax rate of 25.90%. \\n\\n156. In order to make MSME companies more viable and also to \\nencourage firms to migrate to company format, I propose to reduce the \\nincome tax for smaller companies with annual turnover upto ` 50 crore to \\n25%. As per data of Assessment Year 2015-16, there are 6.94 lakh \\ncompanies filing returns of which 6.67 lakh companies fall in this category \\nand, therefore, percentage-wise 96% of companies will get this benefit of \\nlower taxation. This will make our MSME sector more competitive as \\ncompared to large companies. The revenue forgone estimate for this \\nmeasure is expected to be ` 7,200 crore per annum. \\n\\n157. In order to give a boost to banking sector, I propose to increase \\nallowable provision for Non-Performing Asset from 7.5% to 8.5%. This will \\nreduce the tax liability of banks. I also propose to tax interest receivable on \\nactual receipt instead of accrual basis in respect of NPA accounts of all non-\\nscheduled cooperative banks also at par with scheduled banks. This will \\nremove hardship of having to pay tax even when interest income is not \\nrealised. \\n\\n158. Considering the wide range of use of LNG as fuel as well as feed \\nstock for petro-chemicals sector, I propose to reduce the basic customs \\nduty on LNG from 5% to 2.5%. \\n\\n\\x0c\\n159. In order to incentivise domestic value addition and to promote Make \\nin India, I propose to make changes in Customs & Central Excise duties in \\nrespect of certain items which are given in the Annex III of this speech. \\nSome of these proposals are also for addressing duty inversion. \\n\\nPromoting Digital Economy \\n\\n160. There is a scheme of presumptive income tax for small and medium \\ntax payers whose turnover is upto ` 2 crores. At present, 8% of their \\nturnover is counted as presumptive income. I propose to make this 6% in \\nrespect of turnover which is received by non-cash means. This benefit will \\nbe applicable for transactions undertaken in the current year also. \\n\\n161. I propose to limit the cash expenditure allowable as deduction, both \\nfor revenue as well as capital expenditure, to ` 10,000. Similarly, the limit \\nof cash donation which can be received by a charitable trust is being \\nreduced from ` 10,000/- to ` 2000/-. \\n\\n162. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up by the Government for \\nblack money has suggested that no transaction above ` 3 lakh should be \\npermitted in cash. The Government has decided to accept this proposal. \\nSuitable amendment to the Income-tax Act is proposed in the Finance Bill \\nfor enforcing this decision. \\n\\n163. To promote cashless transactions, I propose to exempt BCD, \\nExcise/CV duty and SAD on miniaturised POS card reader for m-POS, micro \\nATM standards version 1.5.1, Finger Print Readers/Scanners and Iris \\nScanners. Simultaneously, I also propose to exempt parts and components \\nfor manufacture of such devices, so as to encourage domestic \\nmanufacturing of these devices. \\n\\nTransparency in Electoral Funding \\n\\n164. India is the world’s largest democracy. Political parties are an \\nessential ingredient of a multi-party Parliamentary democracy. Even 70 \\nyears after Independence, the country has not been able to evolve a \\ntransparent method of funding political parties which is vital to the system \\nof free and fair elections. An attempt was made in the past by amending \\nthe provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, the Companies Act and \\nthe Income Tax Act to incentivise donations by individuals, partnership \\nfirms, HUFs and companies to political parties. Both the donor and the \\ndonee were granted exemption from payment of tax if the accounts were \\ntransparently maintained and returns were filed with the competent \\nauthorities. Additionally, a list of donors who contributed more than \\n`20,000/- to any party in cash or cheque is required to be maintained. The \\n\\n\\x0c\\nsituation has only marginally improved since these provisions were brought \\ninto force. Political parties continue to receive most of their funds through \\nanonymous donations which are shown in cash. \\n\\n165. An effort, therefore, requires to be made to cleanse the system of \\npolitical funding in India. Donors have also expressed reluctance in \\ndonating by cheque or other transparent methods as it would disclose their \\nidentity and entail adverse consequences. I, therefore, propose the \\nfollowing scheme as an effort to cleanse the system of funding of political \\nparties: \\n\\na) In accordance with the suggestion made by the Election Commission, \\nthe maximum amount of cash donation that a political party can \\nreceive will be `2000/- from one person. \\nb) Political parties will be entitled to receive donations by cheque or \\ndigital mode from their donors. \\nc) As an additional step, an amendment is being proposed to the \\nReserve Bank of India Act to enable the issuance of electoral bonds in \\naccordance with a scheme that the Government of India would frame \\nin this regard. Under this scheme, a donor could purchase bonds \\nfrom authorised banks against cheque and digital payments only. \\nThey shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a \\nregistered political party. These bonds will be redeemable within the \\nprescribed time limit from issuance of bond. \\nd) Every political party would have to file its return within the time \\nprescribed in accordance with the provision of the Income-tax Act. \\n\\n\\nNeedless to say that the existing exemption to the political parties from \\npayment of income-tax would be available only subject to the fulfilment of \\nthese conditions. This reform will bring about greater transparency and \\naccountability in political funding, while preventing future generation of \\nblack money. \\n\\nEase of Doing Business \\n\\n166. As an anti-avoidance measure, the provision of domestic transfer \\npricing in respect of related entities was brought in the Finance Act of 2012. \\nSince then the number of entities being covered under domestic pricing has \\ngone up substantially necessitating a longer scrutiny, which causes hardship \\nto domestic companies. In order to reduce the compliance burden due to \\ndomestic transfer pricing provisions, I propose to restrict the scope of \\ndomestic transfer pricing only if one of the entities involved in related party \\ntransaction enjoys specified profit-linked deduction. \\n\\n\\x0c\\n167. I propose to increase the threshold limit for audit of business \\nentities who opt for presumptive income scheme from `1 crore to `2 \\ncrores. Similarly, the threshold for maintenance of books for individuals \\nand HUF is being increased from turnover of `10 lakhs to `25 lakhs or \\nincome from `1.2 lakhs to `2.5 lakhs. \\n\\n168. In 2012, Income-tax Act was amended to provide for taxation of \\nthose transactions of transfer of shares or interest in a foreign entity \\nderiving its value substantially from Indian assets. Apprehensions have \\nbeen raised about some difficulties which arise because of this provision in \\ncase of transfer of stake of investors of India-based funds located abroad \\nbut investing in India-based companies. \\n\\n169. In order to remove this difficulty, I propose to exempt Foreign \\nPortfolio Investor (FPI) Category I & II from indirect transfer provision. I also \\npropose to issue a clarification that indirect transfer provision shall not \\napply in case of redemption of shares or interests outside India as a result \\nof or arising out of redemption or sale of investment in India which is \\nchargeable to tax in India. \\n\\n170. As on today, a TDS of 5% is being deducted from commission \\npayable to individual insurance agents even if the income of some of them \\nmay be below taxable limit. I propose to exempt them from the \\nrequirement of TDS subject to their filing a self-declaration that their \\nincome is below taxable limit. \\n\\n171. Last year, I had announced a new scheme for presumptive taxation \\nfor professionals with receipt upto `50 lakhs p.a. In respect of such \\nassesses, they are being given further benefit in terms of paying advance \\ntax in one instalment instead of four. \\n\\n172. In order to allow the people to claim the refund expeditiously, the \\ntime period for revising a tax return is being reduced to 12 months from \\ncompletion of financial year, at par with the time period for filing of return. \\nAlso the time for completion of scrutiny assessments is being compressed \\nfurther from 21 months to 18 months for Assessment Year 2018-19 and \\nfurther to 12 months for Assessment Year 2019-20 and thereafter. \\n\\nPersonal Income-Tax \\n\\n173. While the Government is trying to bring within tax-net more people \\nwho are evading taxes, the present burden of taxation is mainly on honest \\ntax payers and salaried employees who are showing their income correctly. \\nTherefore, post-demonetisation, there is a legitimate expectation of this \\nclass of people to reduce their burden of taxation. Also an argument is \\n\\n\\x0c\\nmade that if a nominal rate of taxation is kept for lower slab, many more \\npeople will prefer to come within the tax net. \\n\\n174. I, therefore, propose to reduce the existing rate of taxation for \\nindividual assesses between income of `2.5 lakhs to `5 lakhs to 5% from the \\npresent rate of 10%. This would reduce the tax liability of all persons below \\n`5 lakh income either to zero (with rebate) or 50% of their existing liability. \\nIn order not to have duplication of benefit, the existing benefit of rebate \\navailable to the same group of beneficiaries is being reduced to `2500 \\navailable only to assessees upto income of `3.5 lakhs. The combined effect \\nof both these measures will mean that there would be zero tax liability for \\npeople getting income upto `3 lakhs p.a. and the tax liability will only be \\n`2,500 for people with income between `3 and `3.5 lakhs. If the limit of \\n`1.5 lakh under Section 80C for investment is used fully the tax would be \\nzero for people with income of `4.5 lakhs. While the taxation liability of \\npeople with income upto `5 lakhs is being reduced to half, all the other \\ncategories of tax payers in the subsequent slabs will also get a uniform \\nbenefit of `12,500/- per person. The total amount of tax foregone on \\naccount of this measure is `15,500 crores. \\n\\n175. In order to make good some of this revenue loss on account of this \\nrelief, I propose to levy a surcharge of 10% of tax payable on categories of \\nindividuals whose annual taxable income is between `50 lakhs and `1 crore. \\nThe existing surcharge of 15% of Tax on people earning more than `1 crore \\nwill continue. This is likely to give additional revenue of `2,700 crores. \\n\\n176. In order to expand tax net, I also plan to have a simple one-page \\nform to be filed as Income Tax Return for the category of individuals having \\ntaxable income upto `5 lakhs other than business income. Also a person of \\nthis category who files income tax return for the first time would not be \\nsubjected to any scrutiny in the first year unless there is specific information \\navailable with the Department regarding his high value transaction. I \\nappeal to all citizens of India to contribute to Nation Building by making a \\nsmall payment of 5% tax if their income is falling in the lowest slab of `2.5 \\nlakhs to `5 lakhs. \\n\\n177. Some other important proposals for amendment in Tax Laws which \\nare not covered by me in my speech are given in Annex III of this speech. \\n\\nGoods and Services Tax \\n\\n178. There has been substantial progress towards ushering in GST, by far, \\nthe biggest tax reform since independence. Since the enactment of the \\nConstitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, the \\npreparatory work for this path-breaking reform has been a top priority for \\n\\n\\x0c\\nthe Government. In this context, several teams of officers both from the \\nStates and Central Board of Excise and Customs have been working \\ntirelessly to give finishing touch to the Model GST law and rules and other \\ndetails. Government on its part has promptly given effect to various \\nprovisions of the Constitutional Amendment Act, including constitution of \\nthe GST Council. Since then, the GST Council held 9 meetings to discuss \\nvarious issues relating to GST, including broad contours of the GST rate \\nstructure, threshold exemption and parameters for composition scheme, \\ndetails for compensation to States due to implementation of GST, \\nexamination of draft model GST law, draft IGST law and the Compensation \\nLaw and administrative mechanism for GST. It is my privilege to inform this \\naugust house that the GST Council has finalised its recommendations on \\nalmost all the issues based on consensus and after spirited debate and \\ndiscussions. The preparation of IT system for GST is also on schedule. The \\nextensive reach-out efforts to trade and industry for GST will start from 1st \\nApril, 2017 to make them aware of the new taxation system. \\n\\n179. Centre, through the Central Board of Excise & Customs, shall \\ncontinue to strive to achieve the goal of implementation of GST as per \\nschedule without compromising the spirit of co-operative federalism. \\nImplementation of GST is likely to bring more taxes both to Central and \\nState Governments because of widening of tax net. I have preferred not to \\nmake many changes in current regime of Excise & Service Tax because the \\nsame are to be replaced by GST soon. \\n\\nRAPID \\n\\n180. In the Annual Conclave of Tax officers called ‘Rajaswa Gyan Sangam’ \\nheld in June 2016, the Prime Minister had expressed his desire to bring \\nreforms in tax administration in the form of an approach of RAPID which \\nstands for Revenue, Accountability, Probity, Information and Digitisation. \\nThis approach precisely reflects the strategy of Tax Department which is \\nnow formulated. While revenue considerations always remain the focus of \\nRevenue Department, we are trying to bring in maximum use of \\nInformation Technology to remove human contact with assesses as well as \\nto plug tax avoidance. We will try to maximise our efforts for e-assessment \\nin the coming year. We are also using a lot of data mining capability, both \\nin-house and outsourced. We plan to enforce greater accountability of \\nofficers of Tax Department for specific act of commission and omission. I \\nwould like to assure everyone that honest, tax-compliant person would be \\ntreated with dignity and courtesy. \\n\\n181. Madam Speaker, my direct tax proposals for exemptions, etc. would \\nresult in revenue loss of `22,700 crore but after counting for revenue gain \\n\\n\\x0c\\nof `2,700 crore for additional resource mobilisation proposal, the net \\nrevenue loss in direct tax would come to `20,000 crore. There is no \\nsignificant loss or gain in my indirect tax proposals. \\n\\nCONCLUSION \\n\\n182. Madam Speaker, I have outlined the Budget proposals under our \\noverarching agenda: “Transform, Energise and Clean India”. Our emphasis \\nwill now be on implementing all these proposals for the benefit of the \\nfarmers, the poor and the underprivileged sections of our society. \\n\\n 183. Madam Speaker, it is said: “When my aim is right, when my goal is \\nin sight, the winds favour me and I fly”. There is no other day, which is \\nmore appropriate for this, than today. \\n\\n184. With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the \\nHouse. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\nAnnex I to Part A \\n\\nOther measures in the Financial Sector \\n\\n1. The commodities and securities derivative markets will be further \\nintegrated by integrating the participants, brokers, and operational \\nframeworks. \\n2. The process of registration of financial market intermediaries like \\nmutual funds, brokers, portfolio managers, etc. will be made fully \\nonline by SEBI. This will improve ease of doing business. \\n3. A common application form for registration, opening of bank and \\ndemat accounts, and issue of PAN will be introduced for Foreign \\nPortfolio Investors (FPIs). SEBI, RBI and CBDT will jointly put in place \\nthe necessary systems and procedures. This will greatly enhance \\noperational flexibility and ease of access to Indian capital markets. \\n4. Steps will be taken for linking of individual demat accounts with \\nAadhar. \\n5. Presently institutions such as banks and insurance companies are \\ncategorised as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) by SEBI. They are \\neligible for participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked \\nallocations. It is now proposed to allow systemically important \\nNBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be \\ncategorised as QIBs. This will strengthen the IPO market and \\nchannelize more investments. \\n6. Listing and trading of Security Receipts issued by a securitisation \\ncompany or a reconstruction company under the SARFAESI Act will \\nbe permitted in SEBI registered stock exchanges. This will enhance \\ncapital flows in to the securitisation industry and will particularly be \\nhelpful to deal with bank NPAs. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\nAnnex II-A to Part A \\n\\n

Additional Revenue Mobilisation (ARM) and Anti-abuse Measures \\n1.1 It is proposed to extend the provisions of section 115BBDA of the Income-\\ntax Act which provides for levy of tax at the rate of ten per cent. on \\ndividend income exceeding ` 10 lakh, to all resident persons except \\ndomestic companies or trust or institution or fund registered under section \\n12AA or referred to in section 10(23C). Presently, these provisions are \\napplicable only to the individuals, Hindu undivided family (HUF) and firms. \\n1.2 It is proposed to widen the scope of section 56 of the Income-tax Act to \\nprovide that any money, immovable property or specified movable \\nproperty received without consideration or with inadequate consideration, \\nby any person, subject to certain exemption and exceptions, shall be \\ntaxable if its value exceeds rupees fifty thousand. \\n1.3 It is proposed to provide that in case of transfer of unquoted equity shares, \\nwhere the fair market value, determined in the prescribed manner is less \\nthan the consideration received, such fair market value shall be the \\ndeemed value of consideration for the purpose of computation of capital \\ngains. \\n1.4 It is proposed to restrict the exemption from long term capital gains in \\ncase of transfer of listed shares by providing that the exemption, subject to \\nnotification of certain exceptions, shall be available if security transaction \\ntax has been paid at the time of acquisition of such shares where they \\nhave been acquired after 1st October, 2004. \\n1.5 It is proposed to introduce a new provision in the Income-tax Act to \\nprovide for tax deduction at source at the rate of five per cent. by an \\nindividual or HUF, other than those whose books of account are required \\nto be audited, while making payment of rent of an amount exceeding ` \\n50,000 per month. It is also proposed to provide that such tax shall be \\ndeducted and deposited only once in a financial year through a challan-\\ncum-statement. Further, the deductor shall not be required to obtain TAN \\nor file any separate TDS return for this purpose. \\n1.6 In order to align the transfer pricing provisions with the OECD transfer \\npricing guidelines and international best practices, it is proposed to insert a \\nnew section to provide that the assesse shall make secondary adjustment \\nwhere the primary adjustment to the transfer price has been made in \\ncertain cases. The provision shall apply if the primary adjustment exceeds \\none crore rupees and the excess money attributable to the adjustment is \\nnot brought to India within the prescribed time. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n1.7 In order to address the issue of thin capitalisation, it is proposed to provide \\nthat the interest paid by an Indian company or permanent establishment \\nof a foreign company, in excess of thirty percent of earnings before \\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), or interest paid to \\nits associated enterprise, whichever is less, shall not be allowed as \\ndeduction in computing its taxable profit. It is also proposed to allow carry \\nforward and set off of the interest so disallowed for eight assessment \\nyears. \\n1.8 In order to address the existing anomaly of interest deduction in respect of \\nlet out property vis-à-vis self-occupied property, it is proposed to restrict \\nset off of loss from house property against income under any other head \\nduring the current year up to Rs two lakhs. The loss not so set off would be \\nallowed to be carried forward for set off against house property income \\nfor eight assessment years. \\n1.9 It is proposed that donation by an entity registered under section 12A or \\napproved under section 10(23C), to other entity, registered under section \\n12A, with the direction that such donation shall form part of the corpus, \\nshall not be treated as application of income for charitable purposes. \\n\\n\\n2.

I rise to present the Budget for 2018-19. \\n2. Madam, four years ago, we pledged to the people of India to give \\nthis nation an honest, clean and transparent Government. We promised a \\nleadership capable of taking difficult decisions and restoring strong \\nperformance of Indian economy. We promised to reduce poverty, \\nexpedite infrastructure creation and build a strong, confident and a New \\nIndia. When our Government took over, India was considered a part of \\nfragile 5; a nation suffering from policy paralysis and corruption. We have \\ndecisively reversed this. The Government, led by Prime Minister, Shri \\nNarendra Modi, has successfully implemented a series of fundamental \\nstructural reforms. With the result, India stands out among the fastest \\ngrowing economies of the world. \\n3. The journey of economic reforms during the past few years has been \\nchallenging but rewarding. As a result of the reforms undertaken by the \\nGovernment, foreign direct investment has gone up. Measures taken by the \\nGovernment have made it much easier to do business in India. Natural \\nresources are now allocated in a transparent and honest manner. There is a \\npremium on honesty. There was a time when corruption was common-\\nplace. Today, our people, especially our youths, are curious to lead their \\nlives honestly. The indirect tax system, with introduction of Goods and \\nServices Tax, has been made simpler. Benefits to the poor have been \\ntargeted more effectively with use of digital technology. The \\ndemonetization of high value currency has reduced the quantum of cash \\ncurrency and circulation in India. It has increased the taxation base and \\nspurred greater digitization of the economy. The Insolvency and \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nBankruptcy Code (IBC) has changed the lender-debtor relationship. The \\nrecapitalized banks will now have a greater ability to support growth. All \\nthese structural reforms in the medium and long run will help Indian \\neconomy achieve stronger growth for a long time. \\n4. Indian economy has performed very well since our Government \\ntook over in May, 2014. India achieved an average growth of 7.5% in first \\nthree years of our Government. Indian economy is now 2.5 trillion dollar \\neconomy – seventh largest in the world. India is expected to become the \\nfifth largest economy very soon. On Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) basis, \\nwe are already the third largest economy. \\n5. Indian society, polity and economy had shown remarkable \\nresilience in adjusting with the structural reforms. GDP growth at 6.3% in \\nthe second quarter signaled turnaround of the economy. We hope to \\ngrow at 7.2% to 7.5% in the second half. IMF, in its latest Update, has \\nforecast that India will grow at 7.4% next year. Manufacturing sector is \\nback on good growth path. The services, mainstay of our growth, have \\nalso resumed their high growth rates of 8% plus. Our exports are expected \\nto grow at 15% in 2017-18. We are now firmly on course to achieve high \\ngrowth of 8% plus. \\n6. We have taken up programmes to direct the benefits of structural \\nchanges and good growth to reach farmers, poor and other vulnerable \\nsections of our society and to uplift the under-developed regions. This \\nyear’s Budget will consolidate these gains and particularly focus on \\nstrengthening agriculture and rural economy, provision of good health \\ncare to economically less privileged, taking care of senior citizens, \\ninfrastructure creation and working with the States to provide more \\nresources for improving the quality of education in the country. \\n7. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always stressed importance \\nof good governance. He has articulated the vision of ‘‘Minimum \\nGovernment and Maximum Governance’’. This vision has inspired \\nGovernment agencies in carrying out hundreds of reforms in policies, rules \\nand procedures. This transformation is reflected in improvement of India’s \\nranking by 42 places in last three years in the World Bank’s ‘Ease of Doing \\nBusiness’ with India breaking into top 100 for the first time. I would like \\nto congratulate all those who worked to achieve this. \\n8. Now, our Government has taken Ease of Doing business further by \\nstress on \\'Ease of Living\\' for the common men of this country, especially for \\nthose belonging to poor & middle class of the society. Good governance \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nalso aims at minimum interference by the government in the life of \\ncommon people of the country. \\n9. Government is providing free LPG connections to the poor of this \\ncountry through Ujjwala Yojana. Under Saubhagya Yojna 4 crore household \\nare being provided with electricity connections. More than 800 medicines \\nare being sold at lower price through more than 3 thousand Jan Aushadhi \\nCentres. Cost of stents have been controlled. Special scheme for free \\ndialysis of poor have been initiated. Persons belonging to poor and middle \\nclass are also being provided a great relief in interest rates on housing \\nschemes. Efforts are being made to provide all government services, \\nwhether bus or train tickets or individual certificates on line. These include \\npassports which may be delivered at doorstep in two or three days or \\nCompany registration in one day time and these facilities have benefited a \\nlarge section of our country. Certificate attestation is not mandatory, \\ninterviews for appointment in Group C and Group D posts have been done \\naway with. These measures have saved time and money of lakhs of our \\nyouth. Our Government by using modern technology is committed to \\nprovide a relief to those who suffer because of rigid rules and regulations. \\n10. Madam, while undertaking these reforms and programmes, we \\nhave worked sincerely and without weighing the political costs. Our \\nGovernment has ensured that benefits reach eligible beneficiaries and are \\ndelivered to them directly. Many services and benefits are being delivered \\nto the people at their doorsteps or in their accounts. It has reduced \\ncorruption and cost of delivery and has eliminated middlemen in the \\nprocess. Direct Benefit Transfer mechanism of India is the biggest such \\nexercise in the world and is a global success story. \\n\\n\\nSection II \\n\\nInvestment, Expenditure and Policy Initiatives \\n\\nAgriculture and Rural Economy \\n\\n11. My Government is committed for the welfare of farmers. For \\ndecades, country’s agriculture policy and programme had remained \\nproduction centric. We have sought to effect a paradigm shift. Honourable \\nPrime Minister gave a clarion call to double farmers’ income by 2022 \\nwhen India celebrates its 75th year of independence. Our emphasis is on \\ngenerating higher incomes for farmers. We consider agriculture as an \\nenterprise and want to help farmers produce more from the same land \\nparcel at lesser cost and simultaneously realize higher prices for their \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nproduce. Our emphasis is also on generating productive and gainful on-\\nfarm and non-farm employment for the farmers and landless families. \\n12. Madam Speaker, as a result of the hard work of our country\\'s \\nfarmers agriculture production in our country is at a record level. Doing the \\nyear 2016-17 we achieved a record food grain production of around 275 \\nmillion tonnes and around 300 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables. \\n13. Madam Speaker, in our party\\'s manifesto it has been stated that the \\nfarmers should realize at least 50 per cent more than the cost of their \\nproduce, in other words, one and a half times of the cost of their \\nproduction. Government have been very much sensitive to this resolutions \\nand it has declared Minimum support price (MSP) for the majority of rabi \\ncrops at least at one and a half times the cost involved. Now, we have \\ndecided to implement this resolution as a principle for the rest of crops. I \\nam pleased to announce that as per pre-determined principle, Government \\nhas decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at \\none and half times of their production cost. I am confident that this historic \\ndecision will prove an important step towards doubling the income of our \\nfarmers. \\n14. Our Government works with the holistic approach of solving any \\nissue rather than in fragments. Increasing MSP is not adequate and it is \\nmore important that farmers should get full benefit of the announced MSP. \\nFor this, it is essential that if price of the agriculture produce market is less \\nthan MSP, then in that case Government should purchase either at MSP or \\nwork in a manner to provide MSP for the farmers through some other \\nmechanism. Niti Ayog, in consultation with Central and State Governments, \\nwill put in place a fool-proof mechanism so that farmers will get adequate \\nprice for their produce. \\n15. For better price realization, farmers need to make decisions based \\non prices likely to be available after its harvest. Government will create an \\ninstitutional mechanism, with participation of all concerned Ministries, to \\ndevelop appropriate policies and practices for price and demand forecast, \\nuse of futures and options market, expansion of warehouse depository \\nsystem and to take decisions about specific exports and imports related \\nmeasures. \\n16. Madam Speaker, last year, I had announced strengthening of \\ne-NAM and to expand coverage of e-NAM to 585 APMCs. 470 APMCs have \\nbeen connected to e-NAM network and rest will be connected by March, \\n2018. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n17. More than 86% of our farmers are small and marginal. They are \\nnot always in a position to directly transact at APMCs and other wholesale \\nmarkets. We will develop and upgrade existing 22,000 rural haats into \\nGramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs). In these GrAMs, physical \\ninfrastructure will be strengthened using MGNREGA and other \\nGovernment Schemes. These GrAMs, electronically linked to e-NAM and \\nexempted from regulations of APMCs, will provide farmers facility to make \\ndirect sale to consumers and bulk purchasers. \\n18. An Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund with a corpus of `2000 crore \\nwill be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing \\ninfrastructure in the 22000 Grameen Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) and 585 \\nAPMCs. \\n19. Task of connecting all eligible habitations with an all-weather road \\nhas been substantially completed, with the target date brought forward to \\nMarch, 2019 from March 2022. It is now time to strengthen and widen its \\nambit further to include major link routes which connect habitations to \\nagricultural and rural markets (GrAMs), higher secondary schools and \\nhospitals. Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana Phase III will include such \\nlinkages. \\n20. For several years, we have been stating that India is primarily an \\nagriculture based country. As India is primarily an agriculture based country, \\nour districts can specialize in some or other agricultural produce and be \\nknown for it. But special attention is lacking in this regard. There is a need \\nto develop cluster based model in a scientific manner for identified \\nagriculture produces in our districts in the same manner as we have \\ndeveloped model for industrial sector. \\n21. Cultivation of horticulture crops in clusters bring advantages of \\nscales of operations and can spur establishment of entire chain from \\nproduction to marketing, besides giving recognition to the districts for \\nspecific crops. The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare will reorient \\nits ongoing Schemes and promote cluster based development of agri-\\ncommodities and regions in partnership with the Ministries of Food \\nProcessing, Commerce and other allied Ministries. \\n22. Our Government has promoted organic farming in a big way. \\nOrganic farming by Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and Village \\nProducers’ Organizations (VPOs) in large clusters, preferably of 1000 \\nhectares each, will be encouraged. Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) will \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nalso be encouraged to take up organic agriculture in clusters under \\nNational Rural Livelihood Programme. \\n23. Our ecology supports cultivation of highly specialized medicinal and \\naromatic plants. India is also home to a large number of small and cottage \\nindustries that manufacture perfumes, essential oils and other associated \\nproducts. Our Government shall support organized cultivation and \\nassociated industry. I propose to allocate a sum of `200 crore for this \\npurpose. \\n24. Food Processing sector is growing at an average rate of 8% per \\nannum. Prime Minister Krishi Sampada Yojana is our flagship programme \\nfor boosting investment in food processing. Allocation of Ministry of Food \\nProcessing is being doubled from `715 crore in \\nRE 2017-18 to `1400 crore in BE 2018-19. Government will promote \\nestablishment of specialized agro-processing financial institutions in this \\nsector. \\n25. Tomato, onion and potato are basic vegetables consumed \\nthroughout the year. However, seasonal and regional production of these \\nperishable commodities pose a challenge in connecting farmers and \\nconsumers in a manner that satisfies both. My Government proposes to \\nlaunch an ‘‘Operation Greens’’ on the lines of ‘‘Operation Flood’’. \\n‘‘Operation Greens’’ shall promote Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs), \\nagri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management. I propose \\nto allocate a sum of `500 crore for this purpose. \\n26. India’s agri-exports potential is as high as US $ 100 billion against \\ncurrent exports of US $ 30 billion. To realize this potential, export of agri-\\ncommodities will be liberalized. I also propose to set up state-of-the-art \\ntesting facilities in all the forty two Mega Food Parks. \\n27. I propose to extend the facility of Kisan Credit Cards to fisheries and \\nanimal husbandry farmers to help them meet their working capital needs. \\nSmall and marginal farmers will get more benefits. \\n28. Bamboo is ‘Green Gold’. We removed bamboo grown outside \\nforest areas from the definition of trees. Now, I propose to launch a Re-\\nstructured National Bamboo Mission with an outlay of `1290 crore to \\npromote bamboo sector in a holistic manner. \\n29. Many farmers are installing solar water pumps to irrigate their \\nfields. Generation of solar electricity is harvesting of Sun by the farmers \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nusing their lands. Government of India will take necessary measures and \\nencourage State Governments to put in place a mechanism that their \\nsurplus solar power is purchased by the distribution companies or \\nlicencees at reasonably remunerative rates. \\n30. Our Government set up a Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) in \\nNABARD for meeting funding requirement of irrigation works. Scope of the \\nFund would be expanded to cover specified command area development \\nprojects. \\n31. Last year, I had announced setting up of Micro Irrigation Fund \\n(MIF) for facilitating expansion of coverage under micro irrigation and \\nDairy Processing Infrastructure Development Fund (DPIDF) to help finance \\ninvestment in dairying infrastructure. It is now time to expand such \\nfocused investment Funds. I, now, announce setting up a Fisheries and \\nAquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FAIDF) for fisheries sector \\nand an Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) for \\nfinancing infrastructure requirement of animal husbandry sector. Total \\nCorpus of these two new Funds would be `10,000 crore. \\n32. Our Government has been steadily increasing the volume of \\ninstitutional credit for agriculture sector from year-to-year from `8.5 lakh \\ncrore in 2014-15 to `10 lakh crore in 2017-18. I now propose to raise this \\nto `11 lakh crore for the year 2018-19. \\n33. Presently, lessee cultivators are not able to avail crop loans. \\nConsequently, a significant proportion of arable land remains fallow and \\ntenant cultivators are forced to secure credit from usurious money \\nlenders. NITI Aayog, in consultation with State Governments, will evolve a \\nsuitable mechanism to enable access of lessee cultivators to credit without \\ncompromising the rights of the land owners. \\n34. Government will extend a favourable taxation treatment to Farmer \\nProducers Organisations (FPOs) for helping farmers aggregate their needs \\nof inputs, farm services, processing and sale operations. \\nI shall give details in Part B of my speech. \\n35. Air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region has been a cause of concern. \\nA special Scheme will be implemented to support the efforts of the \\ngovernments of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the NCT of Delhi to \\naddress air pollution and to subsidize machinery required for in-situ \\nmanagement of crop residue. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n36. Madam Speaker, the present top leadership of this country has \\nreached at this level after seeing poverty at close quarters. Our leadership is \\nfamiliar with the problems being faced by the SC, ST, Backward Classes and \\neconomically weaker sections of the society. People belonging to poor and \\nmiddle class are not case studies for them, on the other hand they \\nthemselves are case study. \\n37. The Lower and Middle Class have been the focus of our Government \\nduring the last three years. This Government is continuously striving to \\nalleviate all the small and major problems of the poor. \\n38. We launched Prime Minister’s Ujjwala Scheme to make poor women \\nfree from the smoke of wood. Initially our target was to provide free LPG \\nconnections to about 5 crore poor women. But in view of the pace of \\nimplementation of Ujjwala scheme and its popularity among the women, \\nwe propose to increase the target of providing free connection to 8 crore \\npoor women. \\n39. Our Government has launched Prime Minister Saubhagya Yojana for \\nproviding electricity to all households of the country. Under this scheme, \\nfour crores poor households are being provided with electricity connection \\nfree of charge. We are spending `16000 crore under this scheme. You can \\nvery well imagine our anxiety and restlessness even with one hour power \\ncut. Think about those women and children whose houses will not get \\nelectricity. Their life is going to change because of Pradhan Mantri \\nSaubhagya Yojana. \\n40. Swachh Bharat Mission has benefited the poor. Under this mission, \\nGovernment has already constructed more than 6 crore toilets. The positive \\neffect of these toilets is being seen on the dignity of ladies, education of \\ngirls and the overall health of family. Government is planning to construct \\naround 2 crore toilets. \\n41. Madam Speaker, a roof for his family is another concern of the poor. \\nFar from the Benami properties earned by corruption, the poor only desire \\nto have a roof, a small house by his earning of honesty. Our Govt. is helping \\nthem so that they may fulfil the dream of their own house. We have fixed a \\ntarget that every poor of this country may have his own house by 2022. For \\nthis purpose Prime Minister Awas Yojana has been launched in rural and \\nurban areas of the country. Under Prime Minister Awas Scheme Rural, 51 \\nlakhs houses in year 2017-18 and 51 lakh houses during 2018-19 which is \\nmore than one crore houses will be constructed exclusively in rural areas. In \\nurban areas the assistance has been sanctioned to construct 37 lakh houses. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n42. My Government will also establish a dedicated Affordable Housing \\nFund (AHF) in National Housing Bank, funded from priority sector lending \\nshortfall and fully serviced bonds authorized by the Government of India. \\n43. Loans to Self Help Groups of women increased to about Rupees \\n42,500 crore in 2016-17, growing 37% over previous year. The \\nGovernment is confident that loans to SHGs will increase to `75,000 crore \\nby March, 2019. I propose to substantially increase allocation of National \\nRural Livelihood Mission to `5750 crore in 2018-19. \\n44. Ground water irrigation scheme under Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai \\nYojna- Har Khet ko Pani will be taken up in 96 deprived irrigation districts \\nwhere less than 30% of the land holdings gets assured irrigation presently. \\nI have allocated `2600 crore for this purpose. \\n45. As my proposals outlined indicate, focus of the Government next \\nyear will be on providing maximum livelihood opportunities in the rural \\nareas by spending more on livelihood, agriculture and allied activities and \\nconstruction of rural infrastructure. In the year 2018-19, for creation of \\nlivelihood and infrastructure in rural areas, total amount to be spent by \\nthe Ministries will be `14.34 lakh crore, including extra-budgetary and non-\\nbudgetary resources of `11.98 lakh crore. Apart from employment due to \\nfarming activities and self employment, this expenditure will create \\nemployment of 321 crore person days, 3.17 lakh kilometers of rural roads, \\n51 lakh new rural houses, 1.88 crore toilets, and provide 1.75 crore new \\nhousehold electric connections besides boosting agricultural growth. \\nDetails are in Annexure I. \\n\\n\\nHealth, Education and Social Protection \\n\\n46. My Government’s goal is to assist and provide opportunity to every \\nIndian to realize her full potential capable of achieving her economic and \\nsocial dreams. Our Government is implementing a comprehensive social \\nsecurity and protection programme to reach every household of old, \\nwidows, orphaned children, divyaang and deprived as per the Socio-\\nEconomic Caste Census. Allocation on National Social Assistance \\nProgramme this year has been kept at `9975 crore. \\n47. We have managed to get children to School but the quality of \\neducation is still a cause of serious concern. We have now defined \\nlearning outcomes and National Survey of more than 20 lakh children has \\nbeen conducted to assess the status on the ground. This will help in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ndevising a district-wise strategy for improving quality of education. We \\nnow propose to treat education holistically without segmentation from \\npre-nursery to Class 12. \\n48. Improvement in quality of teachers can improve the quality of \\neducation in the country. We will initiate an integrated B.Ed. programme \\nfor teachers. Training of teachers during service is extremely critical. We \\nhave amended the Right to Education Act to enable more than 13 lakh \\nuntrained teachers to get trained. \\n49. Technology will be the biggest driver in improving the quality of \\neducation. We propose to increase the digital intensity in education and \\nmove gradually from ‘‘black board’’ to ‘‘digital board’’. Technology will also \\nbe used to upgrade the skills of teachers through the recently launched \\ndigital portal ‘‘DIKSHA’’. \\n50. The Government is committed to provide the best quality \\neducation to the tribal children in their own environment. To realise this \\nmission, it has been decided that by the year 2022, every block with more \\nthan 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an \\nEkalavya Model Residential School. Ekalavya schools will be on par with \\nNavodaya Vidyalayas and will have special facilities for preserving local art \\nand culture besides providing training in sports and skill development. \\n51. To step up investments in research and related infrastructure in \\npremier educational institutions, including health institutions, I propose to \\nlaunch a major initiative named ‘‘Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in \\nEducation (RISE) by 2022’’ with a total investment of `1,00,000 crore in \\nnext four years. Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) would be \\nsuitably structured for funding this initiative. \\n52. Our Government has taken major initiative of setting up Institutes \\nof Eminence. There has been tremendous response to this initiative by \\ninstitutions both in public and private sectors. We have received more \\nthan 100 applications. We have also taken steps to set up a specialized \\nRailways University at Vadodara. \\n53. We propose to set up two new full-fledged Schools of Planning and \\nArchitecture, to be selected on challenge mode. Additionally, 18 new SPAs \\nwould be established in the IITs and NITs as autonomous Schools, also on \\nchallenge mode. \\n54. The Government would launch the ‘‘Prime Minister’s Research \\nFellows (PMRF)’’ Scheme this year. Under this, we would identify 1,000 \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nbest B.Tech students each year from premier institutions and provide \\nthem facilities to do Ph.D in IITs and IISc, with a handsome fellowship. It is \\nexpected that these bright young fellows would voluntarily commit few \\nhours every week for teaching in higher educational institutions. \\n55. Now I come to the Health Sector. ºÉ´ÉäÇ £É´ÉxiÉÖ: \\nºÉÖÉÊJÉ xÉ, ºÉ´ÉäÇ ºÉÆiÉÖ: ÉÊxÉ®ÉàÉªÉÉ is the guiding \\nprinciple of my Government. Only Swasth Bharat can be a Samriddha \\nBharat. India cannot realize its demographic dividend without its citizens \\nbeing healthy. \\n56. I am pleased to announce two major initiatives as part of \\n‘‘Ayushman Bharat’’ programme aimed at making path breaking \\ninterventions to address health holistically, in primary, secondary and \\ntertiary care system covering both prevention and health promotion. \\n57. The National Health Policy, 2017 has envisioned Health and \\nWellness Centres as the foundation of India’s health system. These 1.5 \\nlakh centres will bring health care system closer to the homes of people. \\nThese centres will provide comprehensive health care, including for non-\\ncommunicable diseases and maternal and child health services. These \\ncentres will also provide free essential drugs and diagnostic services. \\nI am committing `1200 crore in this budget for this flagship programme. I \\nalso invite contribution of private sector through CSR and philanthropic \\ninstitutions in adopting these centres. \\n58. Madam Speaker, we are all aware that lakhs of families in our \\ncountry have to borrow or sell assets to receive indoor treatment in \\nhospitals. Government is seriously concerned about such impoverishment \\nof poor and vulnerable families. Present Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana \\n(RSBY) provide annual coverage of only `30,000 to poor families. Several \\nState Governments have also implemented/supplemented health \\nprotection schemes providing varying coverage. My Government has now \\ndecided to take health protection to more aspirational level. \\n59. We will launch a flagship National Health Protection Scheme to \\ncover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore \\nbeneficiaries) providing coverage upto 5 lakh rupees per family per year \\nfor secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. This will be the world’s \\nlargest government funded health care programme. Adequate funds will \\nbe provided for smooth implementation of this programme. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n60. Madam Speaker, these two far-reaching initiatives under the \\nAyushman Bharat will build a New India 2022 and ensure enhanced \\nproductivity, well being and avert wage loss and impoverishment. These \\nSchemes will also generate lakhs of jobs, particularly for women. The \\nGovernment is steadily but surely progressing towards the goal of Universal \\nHealth Coverage. \\n61. TB claims more lives every year than any other infectious disease. \\nIt affects mainly poor and malnourished people. My Government has, \\ntherefore, decided to allocate additional `600 crore to provide nutritional \\nsupport to all TB patients at the rate of `500 per month for the duration of \\ntheir treatment. \\n62. In order to further enhance accessibility of quality medical \\neducation and health care, we will be setting up 24 new Government \\nMedical Colleges and Hospitals by upgrading existing district hospitals in \\nthe country. This would ensure that there is at least 1 Medical College for \\nevery 3 Parliamentary Constituencies and at least 1 Government Medical \\nCollege in each State of the country. \\n63. Our resolve of making our villages open defecation free is aimed at \\nimproving the life of our villagers. We will launch a Scheme called \\nGalvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBAR-DHAN) for \\nmanagement and conversion of cattle dung and solid waste in farms to \\ncompost, fertilizer, bio-gas and bio-CNG. \\n64. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Beema Yojana (PMJJBY) has benefitted \\n5.22 crore families with a life insurance cover of `2 lakh on payment of a \\npremium of only `330/- per annum. Likewise, under Pradhan Mantri \\nSuraksha Bima Yojana, 13 crore 25 lakh persons have been insured with \\npersonal accident cover of `2 lakh on payment of a premium of only `12 \\nper annum. The Government will work to cover all poor households, \\nincluding SC/ST households, under these in a mission mode. \\n65. The Government will expand the coverage under Prime Minister \\nJan Dhan Yojana by bringing all sixty crore basic accounts within its fold \\nand undertake measures to provide services of micro insurance and \\nunorganized sector pension schemes through these accounts. \\n66. Our commitment towards ‘‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’’ is unflinching. \\nSukanya Samriddhi Account Scheme launched in January 2015 has been a \\ngreat success. Until November, 2017 more than 1.26 crore accounts have \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nbeen opened across the country in the name of girl-child securing an \\namount of `19,183 crore. \\n67. Cleaning the Ganga is work of national importance and it is our \\nfirm commitment. Members will be happy to learn that this work has \\ngathered speed. A total of 187 projects have been sanctioned under the \\nNamami Gange programme for infrastructure development, river surface \\ncleaning, rural sanitation and other interventions at a cost of \\n`16,713 crore. 47 projects have been completed and remaining projects \\nare at various stages of execution. All 4465 Ganga Grams – villages on \\nthe bank of river - have been declared open defecation free. \\n68. To give focused attention and to achieve our vision of an inclusive \\nsociety, the Government has identified 115 aspirational districts taking \\nvarious indices of development in consideration. The Government aims at \\nimproving the quality of life in these districts by investing in social services \\nlike health, education, nutrition, skill upgradation, financial inclusion and \\ninfrastructure like irrigation, rural electrification, potable drinking water \\nand access to toilets at an accelerated pace and in a time bound manner. \\nWe expect these 115 districts to become model of development. \\n69. Economic and social advancement of hard working people of \\nScheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) has received core \\nattention of Government. Our Government increased total earmarked \\nallocation for SCs in 279 programmes from `34,334 crore in 2016-17 to \\n`52,719 crore in RE 2017-18. Likewise, for STs, earmarked allocation was \\nincreased from `21,811 crore in 2016-17 to `32,508 crore in \\nRE 2017-18 in 305 programmes. I propose an earmarked allocation of \\n`56,619 crore for SCs and `39,135 crore for STs in BE 2018-19. \\n70. Government’s estimated schematic budgetary expenditure on \\nhealth, education and social protection for 2018-19 is `1.38 lakh crore \\nagainst estimated expenditure of `1.22 lakh crore in BE 2017-18. Details \\nare in Annexure II. This expenditure is likely to go up by at least `15,000 \\ncrore in 2018-19 on account of additional allocation during the year and \\nextra budgetary expenditure, including through Higher Education Financing \\nAgency. \\n\\n\\nMedium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) and \\nEmployment \\n\\n\\x0c\\n71. Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) are a major engine \\nof growth and employment in the country. I have provided \\n`3794 crore to MSME Sector for giving credit support, capital and interest \\nsubsidy and innovations. Massive formalization of the businesses of \\nMSMEs is taking place in the country after demonetization and \\nintroduction of GST. This is generating enormous financial information \\ndatabase of MSMEs’ businesses and finances. This big data base will be \\nused for improving financing of MSMEs’ capital requirement, including \\nworking capital. \\n72. It is proposed to onboard public sector banks and corporates on \\nTrade Electronic Receivable Discounting System (TReDS) platform and link \\nthis with GSTN. Online loan sanctioning facility for MSMEs will be \\nrevamped for prompt decision making by the banks. Government will \\nsoon announce measures for effectively addressing non-performing assets \\nand stressed accounts of MSMEs. This will enable larger financing of \\nMSMEs and also considerably ease cash flow challenges faced by them. In \\norder to reduce tax burden on MSMEs and to create larger number of \\njobs, I will be announcing some tax measures in Part B of my speech. \\n73. MUDRA Yojana launched in April, 2015 has led to sanction of `4.6 \\nlakh crore in credit from 10.38 crore MUDRA loans. 76% of loan accounts \\nare of women and more than 50% belong to SCs, STs and OBCs. It is \\nproposed to set a target of `3 lakh crore for lending under MUDRA for \\n2018-19 after having successfully exceeded the targets in all previous \\nyears. \\n74. Non-Bank Finance Companies (NBFCs) stepped up financing of \\nMSMEs after demonetization. NBFCs can be very powerful vehicle for \\ndelivering loans under MUDRA. Refinancing policy and eligibility criteria \\nset by MUDRA will be reviewed for better refinancing of NBFCs. \\n75. Use of Fintech in financing space will help growth of MSMEs. A \\ngroup in the Ministry of Finance is examining the policy and institutional \\ndevelopment measures needed for creating right environment for Fintech \\ncompanies to grow in India. \\n76. Venture Capital Funds and the angel investors need an innovative \\nand special developmental and regulatory regime for their growth. We \\nhave taken a number of policy measures including launching ‘‘Start-Up \\nIndia’’ program, building very robust alternative investment regime in the \\ncountry and rolling out a taxation regime designed for the special nature \\nof the VCFs and the angel investors. We will take additional measures to \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nstrengthen the environment for their growth and successful operation of \\nalternative investment funds in India. \\n77. Creating job opportunities and facilitating generation of \\nemployment has been at the core of our policy-making. During the last \\nthree years, we have taken a number of steps to boost employment \\ngeneration in the country. These measures include:- \\n. Contribution of 8.33% of Employee Provident Fund (EPF) for \\nnew employees by the Government for three years. \\n. Contribution of 12% to EPF for new employees for three \\nyears by the Government in sectors employing large \\nnumber of people like textile, leather and footwear. \\n. Additional deduction to the employees of 30% of the wages \\npaid for new employees under the Income Tax Act. \\n. Launch of National Apprenticeship Scheme with stipend \\nsupport and sharing of the cost of basic training by the \\nGovernment to give training to 50 lakh youth by 2020. \\n. Introducing system of fixed term employment for apparel \\nand footwear sector. \\n. Increasing paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, \\nalong with provision of crèches. \\n\\n\\n78. These measures have started showing results. An independent \\nstudy conducted recently has shown that 70 lakh formal jobs will be \\ncreated this year. \\n79. To carry forward this momentum, I am happy to announce that the \\nGovernment will contribute 12% of the wages of the new employees in \\nthe EPF for all the sectors for next three years. Also, the facility of fixed \\nterm employment will be extended to all sectors. \\n80. To incentivize employment of more women in the formal sector \\nand to enable higher take-home wages, I propose to make amendments in \\nthe Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 to \\nreduce women employees\\' contribution to 8% for first three years of their \\nemployment against existing rate of 12% or 10% with no change in \\nemployers\\' contribution. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n81. The Government is setting up a model aspirational skill centre in \\nevery district of the country under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra \\nProgramme. 306 Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra have been established \\nfor imparting skill training through such centers. \\n82. The Government had approved a comprehensive textile sector \\npackage of `6000 crore in 2016 to boost the apparel and made-up \\nsegments. I, now propose to provide an outlay of `7148 crore for the \\ntextile sector in 2018-19. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nInfrastructure and Financial Sector Development \\n\\n83. Infrastructure is the growth driver of economy. Our country needs \\nmassive investments estimated to be in excess of `50 lakh crore in \\ninfrastructure to increase growth of GDP, connect and integrate the nation \\nwith a network of roads, airports, railways, ports and inland waterways \\nand to provide good quality services to our people. \\n84. We have made an all-time high allocation to rail and road sectors. \\nWe are committed to further enhance public investment. Provision of key \\nlinkages like coal for power, power for railways and railway rakes for coal \\nhave been rationalized and made very efficient. Prime Minister personally \\nreviews the targets and achievements in infrastructure sectors on a \\nregular basis. Using online monitoring system of PRAGATI alone, projects \\nworth 9.46 lakh crore have been facilitated and fast tracked. \\n85. To secure India’s defences, we are developing connectivity \\ninfrastructure in border areas. Rohtang tunnel has been completed to \\nprovide all weather connectivity to the Ladakh region. Contract for \\nconstruction of Zozila Pass tunnel of more than 14 kilometer is progressing \\nwell. I now propose to take up construction of tunnel under Sela Pass. For \\npromoting tourism and emergency medical care, Government will make \\nnecessary framework for encouraging investment in sea plane activities. \\n86. Urbanization is our opportunity and priority. My Government has \\nrolled out two interlinked programmes – Smart Cities Mission and the \\nAMRUT. \\n87. Smart Cities Mission aims at building 100 Smart Cities with state-of-\\nthe-art amenities. I am happy to inform that 99 Cities have been selected \\nwith an outlay of `2.04 lakh crore. These Cities have started implementing \\nvarious projects like Smart Command and Control Centre, Smart Roads, \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nSolar Rooftops, Intelligent Transport Systems, Smart Parks. Projects worth \\n`2350 crore have been completed and works of `20,852 crore are under \\nprogress. To preserve and revitalize soul of the heritage cities in India, \\nNational Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) \\nhas been taken up in a major way. \\n88. India is blessed with an abundance of tourist attractions. It is \\nproposed to develop ten prominent tourist sites into Iconic Tourism \\ndestinations by following a holistic approach involving infrastructure and \\nskill development, development of technology, attracting private \\ninvestment, branding and marketing. In addition, tourist amenities at 100 \\nAdarsh monuments of the Archaeological Survey of India will be upgraded \\nto enhance visitor experience. \\n89. The AMRUT programme focuses on providing water supply to all \\nhouseholds in 500 cities. State level plans of `77,640 crore for 500 cities \\nhave been approved. Water supply contracts for 494 projects worth \\n`19,428 crore and sewerage work contract for 272 projects costing `12,429 \\ncrore has been awarded. \\n90. Reforms are being catalyzed by these missions. 482 cities have \\nstarted credit rating. 144 cities have got investment grade rating. \\n91. My Ministry will leverage the India Infrastructure Finance \\nCorporation Limited (IIFCL) to help finance major infrastructure projects, \\nincluding investments in educational and health infrastructure, on strategic \\nand larger societal benefit considerations. \\n92. Our Government has scaled new heights in development of Road \\nInfrastructure sector. We are confident to complete National Highways \\nexceeding 9000 kilometers length during 2017-18. Ambitious Bharatmala \\nPariyojana has been approved for providing seamless connectivity of \\ninterior and backward areas and borders of the country to develop about \\n35000 kms in Phase-I at an estimated cost of `5,35,000 crore. To raise \\nequity from the market for its mature road assets, NHAI will consider \\norganizing its road assets into Special Purpose Vehicles and use innovative \\nmonetizing structures like Toll, Operate and Transfer (TOT) and \\nInfrastructure Investment Funds (InvITs). \\n93. Strengthening the railway network and enhancing Railways’ \\ncarrying capacity has been a major focus of the Government. Railways’ \\nCapex for the year 2018-19 has been pegged at `1,48,528 crore. A large \\npart of the Capex is devoted to capacity creation. 18,000 kilometers of \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ndoubling, third and fourth line works and 5000 kilometers of gauge \\nconversion would eliminate capacity constraints and transform almost \\nentire network into Broad Gauge. \\n94. There has also been significant improvement in the achievement of \\nphysical targets by Railways as well. We are moving fast towards optimal \\nelectrification of railway network. 4000 kilometers are targeted for \\ncommissioning during 2017-18. \\n95. Work on Eastern and Western dedicated Freight Corridors is in full \\nswing. Adequate number of rolling stock – 12000 wagons, 5160 coaches \\nand approximately 700 locomotives are being procured during 2018-19. A \\nmajor programme has been initiated to strengthen infrastructure at the \\nGoods sheds and fast track commissioning of private sidings. \\n96. A ‘Safety First’ policy, with allocation of adequate funds under \\nRashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh is cornerstone of Railways’ focus on safety. \\nMaintenance of track infrastructure is being given special attention. Over \\n3600 kms of track renewal is targeted during the current fiscal. Other \\nmajor steps include increasing use of technology like ‘‘Fog Safe’’ and \\n‘‘Train Protection and Warning System’’. A decision has been taken to \\neliminate 4267 unmanned level crossings in the broad gauge network in \\nthe next two years. \\n97. Redevelopment of 600 major railway stations is being taken up by \\nIndian Railway Station Development Co. Ltd. All stations with more than \\n25000 footfalls will have escalators. All railway stations and trains will be \\nprogressively provided with wi-fi. CCTVs will be provided at all stations \\nand on trains to enhance security of passengers. Modern train-sets with \\nstate-of-the-art amenities and features are being designed at Integrated \\nCoach Factory, Perambur. First such train-set will be commissioned during \\n2018-19. \\n98. Mumbai’s transport system, the lifeline of the City, is being \\nexpanded and augmented to add 90 kilometers of double line tracks at a \\ncost of over `11,000 crore. 150 kilometers of additional suburban network \\nis being planned at a cost of over `40,000 crore, including elevated \\ncorridors on some sections. A suburban network of approximately 160 \\nkilometers at an estimated cost of `17,000 crore is being planned to cater \\nto the growth of the Bengaluru metropolis. \\n99. Foundation for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, India’s \\nfirst high speed rail project was laid on September 14, 2017. An Institute is \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ncoming up at Vadodara to train manpower required for high speed rail \\nprojects. \\n100. In the last three years, the domestic air passenger traffic grew at \\n18% per annum and our airline companies placed orders for more than \\n900 aircrafts. Regional connectivity scheme of UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam \\nNagrik) initiated by the Government last year shall connect 56 unserved \\nairports and 31 unserved helipads across the country. Operations have \\nalready started at 16 such airports. ºÉ®BÉEÉ® BÉEÉÒ <ºÉ {ÉcãÉ \\nºÉä c´ÉÉ<Ç SÉ{{ÉãÉ {ÉcxÉxÉä ´ÉÉãÉä xÉÉMÉÉÊ®BÉE \\n£ÉÉÒ c´ÉÉ<Ç VÉcÉVÉ àÉä ªÉÉjÉÉ BÉE® ®cä cé* Airport \\nAuthority of India (AAI) has 124 airports. We propose to expand our \\nairport capacity more than five times to handle a billion trips a year under \\na new initiative - NABH Nirman. Balance sheet of AAI shall be leveraged to \\nraise more resources for funding this expansion. \\n101. Our efforts to set up a Coalition on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure \\nfor developing international good practices, appropriate standards and \\nregulatory mechanism for resilient infrastructure development are moving \\nwell. I propose to allocate `60 crores to kick start this initiative in 2018-19. \\n102. The Government and market regulators have taken necessary \\nmeasures for development of monetizing vehicles like Infrastructure \\nInvestment Trust (InvIT) and Real Investment Trust (ReITs) in India. The \\nGovernment would initiate monetizing select CPSE assets using InvITs from \\nnext year. \\n103. In the current year, we included, in the scope of harmonized list of \\ninfrastructure, ropeways to promote tourism, logistics parks and expanded \\nthe scope of railways infrastructure to include development of commercial \\nland around railway stations. \\n104. Reserve Bank of India has issued guidelines to nudge Corporates \\naccess bond market. SEBI will also consider mandating, beginning with \\nlarge Corporates, to meet about one-fourth of their financing needs from \\nthe bond market. \\n105. Corporate bonds rated ‘BBB’ or equivalent are investment grade. In \\nIndia, most regulators permit bonds with the ‘AA’ rating only as eligible for \\ninvestment. It is now time to move from ‘AA’ to ‘A’ grade ratings. The \\ngovernment and concerned regulators will take necessary action. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n106. We will take reform measures with respect to stamp duty regime \\non financial securities transactions in consultation with the States and \\nmake necessary amendments the Indian Stamp Act. \\n107. International Financial Service Centre (IFSC) at Gift City, which has \\nbecome operational, needs a coherent and integrated regulatory \\nframework to fully develop and to compete with other offshore financial \\ncentres. The Government will establish a unified authority for regulating \\nall financial services in IFSCs in India. \\n108. Global economy is transforming into a digital economy thanks to \\ndevelopment of cutting edge technologies in digital space – machine \\nlearning, artificial intelligence, internet of things, 3D printing and the like. \\nInitiatives such as Digital India, Start Up India, Make in India would help \\nIndia establish itself as a knowledge and digital society. NITI Aayog will \\ninitiate a national program to direct our efforts in the area of artificial \\nintelligence, including research and development of its applications. \\n109. Combining cyber and physical systems have great potential to \\ntransform not only innovation ecosystem but also our economies and the \\nway we live. To invest in research, training and skilling in robotics, artificial \\nintelligence, digital manufacturing, big data analysis, quantum \\ncommunication and internet of things, Department of Science & \\nTechnology will launch a Mission on Cyber Physical Systems to support \\nestablishment of centres of excellence. I have doubled the allocation on \\nDigital India programme to ` 3073 crore in 2018-19. \\n110. Task of connecting one lakh gram panchayat through high speed \\noptical fiber network has been completed under phase I of the Bharatnet \\nproject. This has enabled broadband access to over 20 crore rural Indians \\nin about two lakh fifty thousand villages. The Government also proposes \\nto setup five lakh wi-fi hotspots which will provide broadband access to \\nfive crore rural citizens. I have provided `10000 crore in 2018-19 for \\ncreation and augmentation of Telecom infrastructure. \\n111. To harness the benefit of emerging new technologies, particularly \\nthe ‘Fifth Generation’ (5G) technologies and its adoption, the Department \\nof Telecom will support establishment of an indigenous 5G Test Bed at IIT, \\nChennai. \\n112. Distributed ledger system or the block chain technology allows \\norganization of any chain of records or transactions without the need of \\nintermediaries. The Government does not consider crypto-currencies legal \\ntender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-\\nassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nThe Government will explore use of block chain technology proactively for \\nushering in digital economy. \\n113. The system of toll payments physically by cash at road toll plazas is \\nbeing fast replaced with Fastags and other electronic payment systems to \\nmake road travel seamless. Number of Fastags has gone up from about \\n60,000 in December, 2016 to more than 10 lakh now. From December, \\n2017 all class ‘‘M’’ and ‘‘N’’ vehicles are being sold only with the Fastags. \\nThe Government will come out with a policy to introduce toll system on \\n‘‘pay as you use’’ basis. \\n114. In order to create employment and aid growth, Government’s \\nestimated budgetary and extra budgetary expenditure on infrastructure \\nfor 2018-19 is being increased to `5.97 lakh crore against estimated \\nexpenditure of `4.94 lakh crore in 2017-18. Details are in Annexure III. \\n\\n\\nBuilding Institutions and Improving Public Service Delivery \\n\\n115. Our armed forces have played a stellar role in meeting the \\nchallenges we have been facing on our borders as well as in managing the \\ninternal security environment both in Jammu and Kashmir and the North \\nEast. I would like to place on record our appreciation for the efforts and \\nthe sacrifices made by the three services in defending the interests of the \\nNation. \\n116. Ever since the NDA Government has assumed office in 2014, lot of \\nemphasis has been given to modernizing and enhancing the operational \\ncapability of the Defence Forces. A number of initiatives have been taken \\nto develop and nurture intrinsic defence production capability to make the \\nNation self-reliant for meeting our defence needs. Ensuring adequate \\nbudgetary support will be our priority. \\n117. We have opened up private investment in defence production \\nincluding liberalizing foreign direct investment. We will take measures to \\ndevelop two defence industrial production corridors in the country. The \\nGovernment will also bring out an industry friendly Defence Production \\nPolicy 2018 to promote domestic production by public sector, private \\nsector and MSMEs. \\n118. Aadhar has provided an identity to every Indian. Aadhar has eased \\ndelivery of so many public services to our people. Every enterprise, major \\nor small, also needs a unique ID. The Government will evolve a Scheme to \\nassign every individual enterprise in India a \\nunique ID. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n119. To carry the business reforms for ease of doing business deeper \\nand in every State of India, the Government of India has identified 372 \\nspecific business reform actions. All States have taken up these reforms \\nand simplifications in a mission mode constructively competing with each \\nother. Evaluation of performance under this Programme will now be \\nbased on user feedback. \\n120. Capital of the Food Corporation of India will be restructured to \\nenhance equity and to raise long-term debt for meeting its standing \\nworking capital requirement. \\n121. Budgeting of Government of India’s contribution in equity and debt \\nof the metro ventures floated by the State Governments will be \\nstreamlined. \\n122. Department of Commerce will be developing a National Logistics \\nPortal as a single window online market place to link all stakeholders. \\n123. The Government has approved listing of 14 CPSEs, including two \\ninsurance companies, on the stock exchanges. The Government has also \\ninitiated the process of strategic disinvestment in 24 CPSEs. This includes \\nstrategic privatization of Air India. \\n124. Process of acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation by the \\nONGC has been successfully completed. Three public sector general \\ninsurance companies National Insurance Company Ltd., United India \\nAssurance Company Limited and Oriental India Insurance Company Limited \\nwill be merged into a single insurance entity and will be subsequently \\nlisted. \\n125. The Government introduced Exchange Traded Fund Bharat-22 to \\nraise `14,500 crore, which was over-subscribed in all segments. DIPAM will \\ncome up with more ETF offers including debt ETF. \\n126. 2017-18 Budget Estimates for disinvestment were pegged at the \\nhighest ever level of `72,500 crore. I am happy to inform the House that \\nwe have already exceeded the budget estimates. I am assuming receipts of \\n`1,00,000 crore in 2017-18. I am setting the disinvestment target of \\n`80,000 crore for 2018-19. \\n127. Bank recapitalization program has been launched with bonds of \\n`80,000 crore being issued this year. The programme has been integrated \\nwith an ambitious reform agenda, under the rubric of an Enhanced Access \\nand Service Excellence (EASE) programme. This recapitalization will pave \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nthe way for the public sector banks to lend additional credit of `5 lakh \\ncrore. \\n128. It is proposed to allow strong Regional Rural Banks to raise capital \\nfrom the market to enable them increase their credit to rural economy. \\n129. National Housing Bank Act is being amended to transfer its equity \\nfrom the Reserve Bank of India to the Government. Indian Post Offices \\nAct, Provident Fund Act and National Saving Certificate Act are being \\namalgamated and certain additional people friendly measures are being \\nintroduced. To provide the Reserve Bank of India an instrument to manage \\nexcess liquidity, Reserve Bank of India Act is being amended to \\ninstitutionalize an Uncollateralized Deposit Facility. Securities and \\nExchange Board of India, Act 1992, Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act \\n1956, and Depositories Act 1996, are being amended to streamline \\nadjudication procedures and to provide for penalties for certain \\ninfractions. These proposals are in the Finance Bill. \\n130. For easier access, links to all Detailed Demand for Grants will be \\nprovided at india.gov.in. The Government will also consider feasibility of \\nproviding disclosed fiscal information in a machine readable form. \\n131. The Government is transforming method of disposal of its business \\nby introduction of e-office and other e-governance initiatives in central \\nMinistries and Departments. These initiatives are listed in Annexure IV. \\n132. The Government will formulate a comprehensive Gold Policy to \\ndevelop gold as an asset class. The Government will also establish a \\nsystem of consumer friendly and trade efficient system of regulated gold \\nexchanges in the country. Gold Monetization Scheme will be revamped to \\nenable people to open a hassle-free Gold Deposit Account. \\n133. Outward Direct Investment (ODI) from India has grown to US$15 \\nbillion per annum. The Government will review existing guidelines and \\nprocesses and bring out a coherent and integrated Outward Direct \\nInvestment (ODI) policy. \\n134. Hybrid instruments are suitable for attracting foreign investments \\nin several niche areas, especially for the startups and venture capital firms. \\nThe Government will evolve a separate policy for the hybrid instruments. \\n135. The emoluments of the President, the Vice President and the \\nGovernors were last revised with effect from 1st January, 2006. These \\nemoluments are proposed to be revised to `5 lakh for the President, \\n`4 lakhs for the Vice President and to `3.5 lakh per month for the \\nGovernors. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n136. There has been a public debate with regard to the emoluments \\npaid to the Members of Parliament. Present practice allows the recipients \\nto fix their own emoluments which invites criticism. I am, therefore, \\nproposing necessary changes to refix the salary, constituency allowance, \\noffice expenses and meeting allowance payable to Members of Parliament \\nwith effect from April 1, 2018. The law will also provide for automatic \\nrevision of emoluments every five years indexed to inflation. I am sure \\nHon’ble Members will welcome this initiative and will not suffer such \\ncriticism in future. \\n137. Our country will commemorate 150th birth anniversary of \\nMahatma Gandhi, Father of the Nation, from 2nd October, 2019 to 2nd \\nOctober 2020. The Government and the People of India will rededicate \\nthem, through their actions, to the ideals that the Mahatma taught and \\nlived by. A National Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, which \\nincludes Chief Ministers of all the States, representatives from across the \\npolitical spectrum, Gandhians, thinkers and eminent persons from all walks \\nof life, has been constituted to formulate a Commemoration Programme. \\nMy Government has earmarked `150 crore for the year 2018-19 for the \\nactivities leading to the Commemoration. \\n\\n\\nSection III - Fiscal Management \\n\\n138. I now turn to the fiscal situation for 2017-18 and fiscal estimates \\nfor 2018-19. \\n139. In 2017-18, Central Government will be receiving GST revenues \\nonly for 11 months, instead of 12 months. This will have fiscal effect. \\nThere has also been some shortfall in Non-Tax revenues on account of \\ncertain developments, including deferment of spectrum auction. A part of \\nthis shortfall has been made up through higher direct tax revenues and \\nbigger disinvestment receipts. \\n140. Total Revised Estimates for expenditure in 2017-18 are `21.57 lakh \\ncrore (net of GST compensation transfers to the States) as against the \\nBudget Estimates of `21.47 lakh crore. \\n141. Our Government assumed office in May, 2014 when fiscal deficit \\nwas running at very high levels. Fiscal Deficit for 2013-14 was 4.4% of GDP. \\nThe Prime Minister and the Government have always attached utmost \\npriority to prudent fiscal management and controlling fiscal deficit. As \\nHon’ble Members would recall, we embarked on the path of consistent \\nfiscal reduction and consolidation in 2014. Fiscal Deficit was brought \\ndown to 4.1% in 2014-15 to 3.9% in 2015-16, and to 3.5% in 2016-17. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nRevised Fiscal Deficit estimates for 2017-18 are `5.95 lakh crore at 3.5% of \\nGDP. I am projecting a Fiscal Deficit of 3.3% of GDP for the year 2018-19. \\n142. In order to impart unquestionable credibility to the Government’s \\ncommitment for the revised fiscal glide path, I am proposing to accept key \\nrecommendations of the Fiscal Reform and Budget Management \\nCommittee relating to adoption of the Debt Rule and to bring down \\nCentral Government’s Debt to GDP ratio to 40%. Government has also \\naccepted the recommendation to use Fiscal Deficit target as the key \\noperational parameter. Necessary amendment proposals are included in \\nthe Finance Bill. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nPART B \\n\\n \\n\\nMadam Speaker, \\n\\n143. I shall now present my tax proposals. \\n144. The attempts made by our Government for reducing the cash \\neconomy and for increasing the tax net have paid rich dividends. The \\ngrowth rate of direct taxes in the financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18 has \\nbeen significant. We ended the last year with a growth of 12.6% in direct \\ntaxes and in the current year, the growth in direct taxes up to 15th January, \\n2018 is 18.7%. The average buoyancy in personal income tax of seven years \\npreceding these two years comes to 1.1. In simple terms tax buoyancy of \\n1.1 means that if nominal GDP growth rate of the country is 10%, the \\ngrowth rate of personal income tax is 11%. However, the buoyancy in \\npersonal income tax for financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18 (RE) is 1.95 \\nand 2.11 respectively. This indicates that the excess revenue collected in \\nthe last two financial years from personal income tax compared to the \\naverage buoyancy pre 2016-17 amounts to a total of about `90,000 crores \\nand the same can be attributed to the strong anti-evasion measures taken \\nby the Government. \\n145. Similarly, there has been huge increase in the number of returns \\nfiled by taxpayers. In financial year 2016-17, 85.51 lakhs new taxpayers filed \\ntheir returns of income as against 66.26 lakhs in the immediately preceding \\nyear. By including all filers as well as persons who did not file returns but \\npaid tax by way of advance tax or TDS, we can derive the figure of Effective \\nTaxpayer Base. This number of effective tax payer base increased from 6.47 \\ncrores at the beginning of F.Y.14-15 to 8.27 crores at the end of F.Y.16-17. \\nWe are enthused by this success of our measures and we pledge to \\ncontinue to take all such measures in future by which the black money is \\ncontained and the honest taxpayers are rewarded. Demonetization was \\nreceived well by honest taxpayers as “imandari ka utsav” only for this \\nreason. \\n146. Madam Speaker, recognising the need for facilitating compliance, \\nGovernment had liberalized the presumptive income scheme for small \\ntraders and entrepreneurs with annual turnover of less than `2 crores and \\nintroduced a similar scheme for professionals with annual turnover of less \\nthan `50 lakhs with the hope that there would be significant increase in \\ncompliance. Under this scheme, 41% more returns were filed during this \\nyear which shows that many more persons are joining the tax net under \\nsimplified scheme. However, the turnover shown is still not encouraging. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nThe Department has received 44.72 lakh returns for assessment year \\n2017-18 from individual, HUF and firms with a meagre average turnover of \\n`17.97 lakhs and an average tax payment of `7,000/- only. The tax \\ncompliance behaviour of professionals is no better; the department has \\nreceived 5.68 lakh returns under the presumptive income scheme for \\nassessment year 2017-18 with average gross receipts of `5.73 lakhs only. \\nAverage tax paid by them is only `35,000/-. \\n\\n\\nTax incentive for promoting post-harvest activities of agriculture \\n\\n147. Madam Speaker, at present, hundred per cent deduction is allowed \\nin respect of profit of co-operative societies which provide assistance to its \\nmembers engaged in primary agricultural activities. Over the last few years, \\na number of Farmer Producer Companies have been set up along the lines \\nof co-operative societies which also provide similar assistance to their \\nmembers. In order to encourage professionalism in post-harvest value \\naddition in agriculture, I propose to allow hundred per cent deduction to \\nthese companies registered as Farmer Producer Companies and having \\nannual turnover up to `100 crores in respect of their profit derived from \\nsuch activities for a period of five years from financial year 2018-19. This \\nmeasure will encourage “Operation Greens” mission announced by me \\nearlier and it will give a boost to Sampada Yojana. \\n\\n\\nEmployment generation \\n\\n148. Currently, a deduction of 30% is allowed in addition to normal \\ndeduction of 100 % in respect of emoluments paid to eligible new \\nemployees who have been employed for a minimum period of 240 days \\nduring the year under section 80-JJAA of the Income-tax Act. However, the \\nminimum period of employment is relaxed to 150 days in the case of \\napparel industry. In order to encourage creation of new employment, \\nI propose to extend this relaxation to footwear and leather industry. \\nFurther, I also propose to rationalise this deduction of 30% by allowing the \\nbenefit for a new employee who is employed for less than the minimum \\nperiod during the first year but continues to remain employed for the \\nminimum period in subsequent year. \\n\\n\\nIncentive for real estate \\n\\n149. Currently, while taxing income from capital gains, business profits \\nand other sources in respect of transactions in immovable property, the \\nconsideration or circle rate value, whichever is higher, is adopted and the \\ndifference is counted as income both in the hands of the purchaser and \\nseller. Sometimes, this variation can occur in respect of different properties \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nin the same area because of a variety of factors including shape of the plot \\nand location. In order to minimize hardship in real estate transaction, \\nI propose to provide that no adjustment shall be made in a case where the \\ncircle rate value does not exceed 5% of the consideration. \\n\\n\\nIncentivising micro, small and medium entrepreneurs \\n\\n150. In the Union Budget, 2017, I had announced the reduction of \\ncorporate tax rate to 25% for companies whose turnover was less than `50 \\ncrore in financial year 2015-16. This benefitted 96% of the total companies \\nfiling tax returns. Towards fulfilment of my promise to reduce corporate tax \\nrate in a phased manner, I now propose to extend the benefit of this \\nreduced rate of 25% also to companies who have reported turnover up to \\n`250 crore in the financial year 2016-17. This will benefit the entire class of \\nmicro, small and medium enterprises which accounts for almost 99% of \\ncompanies filing their tax returns. The estimate of revenue forgone due to \\nthis measure is `7,000 crores during the financial year 2018-19. After this, \\nout of about 7 lakh companies filing returns, about 7,000 companies which \\nfile returns of income and whose turnover is above `250 crores will remain \\nin 30% slab. The lower corporate income tax rate for 99% of the companies \\nwill leave them with higher investible surplus which in turn will create more \\njobs. \\n\\n\\nRelief to salaried taxpayers \\n\\n151. The Government had made many positive changes in the personal \\nincome-tax rate applicable to individuals in the last three years. Therefore, \\nI do not propose to make any further change in the structure of the income \\ntax rates for individuals. There is a general perception in the society that \\nindividual business persons have better income as compared to salaried \\nclass. However, income tax data analysis suggests that major portion of \\npersonal income-tax collection comes from the salaried class. For \\nassessment year 2016-17, 1.89 crore salaried individuals have filed their \\nreturns and have paid total tax of `1.44 lakh crores which works out to \\naverage tax payment of `76,306/- per individual salaried taxpayer. As \\nagainst this, 1.88 crores individual business taxpayers including \\nprofessionals, who filed their returns for the same assessment year paid \\ntotal tax of `48,000 crores which works out to an average tax payment of \\n`25,753/- per individual business taxpayer. In order to provide relief to \\nsalaried taxpayers, I propose to allow a standard deduction of `40,000/- in \\nlieu of the present exemption in respect of transport allowance and \\nreimbursement of miscellaneous medical expenses. However, the transport \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nallowance at enhanced rate shall continue to be available to differently- \\nabled persons. Also other medical reimbursement benefits in case of \\nhospitalization etc., for all employees shall continue. Apart from reducing \\npaper work and compliance, this will help middle class employees even \\nmore in terms of reduction in their tax liability. This decision to allow \\nstandard deduction shall significantly benefit the pensioners also, who \\nnormally do not enjoy any allowance on account of transport and medical \\nexpenses. The revenue cost of this decision is approximately `8,000 crores. \\nThe total number of salaried employees and pensioners who will benefit \\nfrom this decision is around 2.5 crores. \\n\\n\\nRelief to senior citizen \\n\\n152. A life with dignity is a right of every individual in general, more so for \\nthe senior citizens. To care of those who cared for us is one of the highest \\nhonours. To further the objective of providing a dignified life, I propose to \\nannounce the following incentives for senior citizens: \\n. Exemption of interest income on deposits with banks and post \\noffices to be increased from `10,000/- to `50,000/- and TDS shall not \\nbe required to be deducted on such income, under section 194A. \\nThis benefit shall be available also for interest from all fixed deposits \\nschemes and recurring deposit schemes. \\n. Raising the limit of deduction for health insurance premium and/ or \\nmedical expenditure from `30,000/- to `50,000/-, under section 80D. \\nAll senior citizens will now be able to claim benefit of deduction up \\nto `50,000/- per annum in respect of any health insurance premium \\nand/or any general medical expenditure incurred. \\n. Raising the limit of deduction for medical expenditure in respect of \\ncertain critical illness from, `60,000/- in case of senior citizens and \\nfrom `80,000/- in case of very senior citizens, to `1 lakh in respect of \\nall senior citizens, under section 80DDB. \\n\\n\\nThese concessions will give extra tax benefit of `4,000 crores to senior \\ncitizens. In addition to tax concessions, I propose to extend the Pradhan \\nMantri Vaya Vandana Yojana up to March, 2020 under which an assured \\nreturn of 8% is given by Life Insurance Corporation of India. The existing \\nlimit on investment of `7.5 lakh per senior citizen under this scheme is also \\nbeing enhanced to `15 lakh. \\n\\nTax incentive for International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) \\n\\n\\x0c\\n153. The Government had endeavoured to develop a world class \\ninternational financial services centre in India. In recent years, various \\nmeasures including tax incentives have been provided in order to fulfil this \\nobjective. To further this objective, I propose to provide two more \\nconcessions for IFSC. In order to promote trade in stock exchanges located \\nin IFSC, I propose to exempt transfer of derivatives and certain securities by \\nnon-residents from capital gains tax. Further, non-corporate taxpayers \\noperating in IFSC shall be charged Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) at \\nconcessional rate of 9% at par with Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) \\napplicable for corporates. \\n\\n\\nFurther Measures to control cash economy: \\n\\n154. Currently, the income of trusts and institutions is exempt if they \\nutilise their income towards their objects in accordance with the relevant \\nprovisions of the Income-tax Act. However, there is no restriction on these \\nentities for incurring expenditure in cash. In order to have audit trail of the \\nexpenses incurred by these entities, it is proposed that payments exceeding \\n`10,000/- in cash made by such entities shall be disallowed and the same \\nshall be subject to tax. Further, in order to improve TDS compliance by \\nthese entities, I propose to provide that in case of non-deduction of tax, \\n30% of the amount shall be disallowed and the same shall be taxed. \\n\\n\\nRationalisation of Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) \\n\\n155. Madam Speaker, currently, long term capital gains arising from \\ntransfer of listed equity shares, units of equity oriented fund and unit of a \\nbusiness trust are exempt from tax. With the reforms introduced by the \\nGovernment and incentives given so far, the equity market has become \\nbuoyant. The total amount of exempted capital gains from listed shares and \\nunits is around `3,67,000 crores as per returns filed for A.Y.17-18. Major \\npart of this gain has accrued to corporates and LLPs. This has also created a \\nbias against manufacturing, leading to more business surpluses being \\ninvested in financial assets. The return on investment in equity is already \\nquite attractive even without tax exemption. There is therefore a strong \\ncase for bringing long term capital gains from listed equities in the tax net. \\nHowever, recognising the fact that vibrant equity market is essential for \\neconomic growth, I propose only a modest change in the present regime. \\nI propose to tax such long term capital gains exceeding `1 lakh at the rate of \\n10% without allowing the benefit of any indexation. However, all gains up \\nto 31st January, 2018 will be grandfathered. For example, if an equity share \\nis purchased six months before 31st January, 2018 at `100/- and the highest \\nprice quoted on 31st January, 2018 in respect of this share is `120/-, there \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nwill be no tax on the gain of `20/- if this share is sold after one year from the \\ndate of purchase. However, any gain in excess of `20 earned after 31st \\nJanuary, 2018 will be taxed at 10% if this share is sold after 31st July, 2018. \\nThe gains from equity share held up to one year will remain short term \\ncapital gain and will continue to be taxed at the rate of 15%. Further, \\nI also propose to introduce a tax on distributed income by equity oriented \\nmutual fund at the rate of 10%. This will provide level playing field across \\ngrowth oriented funds and dividend distributing funds. In view of \\ngrandfathering, this change in capital gain tax will bring marginal revenue \\ngain of about `20,000 crores in the first year. The revenues in subsequent \\nyears may be more. \\n\\n\\nHealth and Education Cess \\n\\n156. Madam Speaker, at present there is a three per cent cess on \\npersonal income tax and corporation tax consisting of two per cent cess for \\nprimary education and one per cent cess for secondary and higher \\neducation. In order to take care of the needs of education and health of BPL \\nand rural families, I have announced programs in Part A of my speech. To \\nfund this, I propose to increase the cess by one per cent. The existing three \\nper cent education cess will be replaced by a four per cent “Health and \\nEducation Cess” to be levied on the tax payable. This will enable us to \\ncollect an estimated additional amount of `11,000 crores. \\n\\n\\nE-assessment. \\n\\n157. We had introduced e-assessment in 2016 on a pilot basis and in \\n2017, extended it to 102 cities with the objective of reducing the interface \\nbetween the department and the taxpayers. With the experience gained so \\nfar, we are now ready to roll out the E-assessment across the country, \\nwhich will transform the age-old assessment procedure of the income tax \\ndepartment and the manner in which they interact with taxpayers and \\nother stakeholders. Accordingly, I propose to amend the Income-tax Act to \\nnotify a new scheme for assessment where the assessment will be done in \\nelectronic mode which will almost eliminate person to person contact \\nleading to greater efficiency and transparency. \\n158. My other tax proposals on direct tax are listed in Annexure 5 of my \\nspeech. \\n\\n\\nIndirect Tax. \\n\\n159. On the Indirect Taxes side, this is the first budget after the roll out of \\nthe Goods and Service Tax. Excise duties to a large extent and service tax \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nhave been subsumed in GST, along with corresponding duties on imports. \\nHence, my budget proposals are mainly on the customs side. \\n160. In this budget, I am making a calibrated departure from the \\nunderlying policy in the last two decades, wherein the trend largely was to \\nreduce the customs duty. There is substantial potential for domestic value \\naddition in certain sectors, like food processing, electronics, auto \\ncomponents, footwear and furniture. To further incentivise the domestic \\nvalue addition and Make in India in some such sectors, I propose to increase \\ncustoms duty on certain items. I propose to increase customs duty on \\nmobile phones from 15% to 20%, on some of their parts and accessories to \\n15% and on certain parts of TVs to 15%. This measure will promote creation \\nof more jobs in the country. Details of changes made in rates of customs \\nduty as well as certain changes made in the excise duty structure are given \\nin Annexure 6 to my speech. \\n161. To help the cashew processing industry, I propose to reduce \\ncustoms duty on raw cashew from 5% to 2.5%. \\n162. I propose to abolish the Education Cess and Secondary and Higher \\nEducation Cess on imported goods, and in its place impose a Social Welfare \\nSurcharge, at the rate of 10% of the aggregate duties of Customs, on \\nimported goods, to provide for social welfare schemes of the Government. \\nGoods which were hitherto exempt from Education Cesses on imported \\ngoods will, however, be exempt from this Surcharge. In addition, certain \\nspecified goods, mentioned in the Annexure 6 to my speech will attract the \\nproposed Surcharge at the rate of 3% of the aggregate duties of customs \\nonly. \\n163. I also propose to make certain changes to the Customs Act, 1962, to \\nfurther improve ease of doing business in cross border trade, and to align \\ncertain provisions with the commitments under the Trade Facilitation \\nAgreement. To smoothen dispute resolution processes and to reduce \\nlitigation, certain amendments are being made, to provide for pre-notice \\nconsultation, definite timelines for adjudication and deemed closure of \\ncases if those timelines are not adhered to. \\n164. With the roll out of GST, I propose to change the name of Central \\nBoard of Excise and Customs [CBEC] to Central Board of Indirect Taxes and \\nCustoms (CBIC). The necessary changes in law for this are proposed in the \\nFinance Bill. \\n165. Madam, while making the proposals in this year’s Budget, we have \\nbeen guided by our mission to especially strengthen agriculture, rural \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ndevelopment, health, education, employment, MSME and infrastructure \\nsectors of Indian economy. I am sure the New India which we aspire to \\ncreate now will emerge. Swami Vivekanand had also envisioned decades \\nago in his Memoirs of European Travel, ‘‘You merge yourselves in the void \\nand disappear, and let new India arise in your place. Let her arise – out of \\nthe peasants’ cottage, grasping the plough; out of the huts of the fisherman. \\nLet her spring from the grocer’s shop, from beside the oven of the fritter-\\nseller. Let her emanate from the factory, from marts, and from markets. \\nLet her emerge from groves and forests, from hills and mountains’’. \\n166. With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the \\nHouse. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAnnexure I \\n\\n(as referred in para 45) \\n\\n \\n\\nBudgetary & Non-Budgetary Resources on Agriculture & other Livelihood \\nProgrammes in Rural Area \\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(`crore) \\n\\nName of \\nScheme \\n\\nInfrastructure/ \\nLivelihood / \\nBoth \\n\\n2018-19 targets \\n\\nPhysical Target \\n\\nFinancial Target \\n\\nGBS \\n\\nEBR \\n\\nTotal \\n\\nM/o Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation \\n\\nPMKSY-AIBP \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\n48 AIBP priority \\nProjects by December \\n2019 \\n\\n \\n\\n15000 \\n\\n15000 \\n\\nPMKSY-HKKP \\n(CADWM) \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\nUtilisation of irrigation \\npotential of 15 lakh \\nHectare \\n\\n2300 \\n\\n \\n\\n2300 \\n\\nOther Schemes \\nof MoWR, \\nRD&GR \\n\\nBoth \\n\\n \\n\\n1461 \\n\\n \\n\\n1461 \\n\\nSub-total MoWR,RD&GR \\n\\n \\n\\n3761 \\n\\n15000 \\n\\n18761 \\n\\nDepartment of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare \\n\\nPradhan Mantri \\nFasal Bima \\nYojna \\n\\nLivelihood \\n\\n98 million ha Gross \\nCrop Area \\n\\n13000 \\n\\n \\n\\n13000 \\n\\nInterest Subsidy \\nfor short term \\ncredit to \\nFarmers \\n\\nLivelihood \\n\\n \\n\\n15000 \\n\\n \\n\\n15000 \\n\\nPradhan Mantri \\nKrishi Sinchayee \\nYojana \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\nIrrigation projects \\ncovering 17.2 lakh ha \\n\\n4000 \\n\\n \\n\\n4000 \\n\\nLivelihood \\n\\n15 lakh beneficiaries \\n\\nNational Food \\nSecurity \\nMission \\n\\nLivelihood \\n\\n1.81 lakh beneficiaries \\n\\n1500 \\n\\n \\n\\n1500 \\n\\nSub Mission on \\nAgricultural \\nMechanization \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\n62466 centres for \\nAgriculture Machinery \\nand equipment, Farm \\nMachinery Banks, Hi-\\nTech Productive \\nEquipment \\n\\n1100 \\n\\n \\n\\n1100 \\n\\nLivelihood \\n\\n17.81 lakh \\nbeneficiaries \\n\\nRashtriya Krishi \\nVikas Yojana \\n(RKVY) \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\n10,45,878 Cold \\nStorage, Godowns, \\nGlass Houses, Custom \\nHiring Centers, Soil/ \\nSeed Testing Labs, etc. \\n\\n3100 \\n\\n \\n\\n3100 \\n\\nLivelihood \\n\\n116.99 lakh \\nbeneficiaries \\n\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nMission for \\nIntegrated \\nDevelopment of \\nHorticulture \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\n3,30,436 centres \\n\\n1599 \\n\\n \\n\\n1599 \\n\\nOther Schemes \\nof D/o AC&FW \\n\\nBoth \\n\\n \\n\\n2912 \\n\\n \\n\\n2912 \\n\\nSub-total of D/o AC&FW \\n\\n \\n\\n42211 \\n\\n \\n\\n42211 \\n\\nMinistry of Food Processing \\n\\nScheme for \\nMega Food \\nParks \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\n12 Mega Food Parks \\n\\n390 \\n\\n1170 \\n\\n1560 \\n\\nLivelihood \\n\\nDirect & indirect \\nemployment to 95000 \\npersons in 2017-18 & \\n2018-19 \\n\\nScheme for \\nCold Chain and \\nValue Addition \\nInfrastructure \\n\\nInfrastructure \\n\\n101 projects \\n\\n220 \\n\\n880 \\n\\n1100 \\n\\nLivelihood \\n\\nDirect: 12000 & \\nindirect: 63000 \\nemployment in 2017-\\n18 & 2018-19 \\n\\nOther Schemes \\nof M/o Food \\nProcessing \\n\\nBoth \\n\\n \\n\\n210 \\n\\n640 \\n\\n850 \\n\\nSub-total of M/o Food \\nProcessing \\n\\n \\n\\n820 \\n\\n2690 \\n\\n3510 \\n\\nDepartment of Agriculture, Research and Education \\n\\nDARE \\n\\nLivelihood \\n\\nProduction of 21960 \\ntons Seeds, 255 lakh \\nnos. planting material, \\n132.5 lakh nos.

I am deeply conscious of the absence of Shri Arun Jaitley today. \\nI am sure the House joins me in wishing Shri Jaitley speedy recovery, good \\nhealth and a long life in the service of the nation. \\n3. Madam Speaker, the people of India gave a strong mandate to our \\nGovernment. Under the visionary leadership of Hon\\'ble Prime Minister Shri \\nNarendra Modi, we have given the most decisive, stable and clean \\nGovernment and have undertaken transformational structural reforms. We \\nhave reversed the policy paralysis engulfing the nation and have restored the \\nimage of the country. The major achievement of this Government was that we \\nstrived our utmost to change the mind-set and ignited the self-confidence of \\nthe nation. \\n4. I can proudly say that India is solidly back on track and marching \\ntowards growth and prosperity. We have prepared the foundation for \\nsustainable growth, progress and better quality of life for all our people. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n5. We are moving towards realising a ‘New India’ by 2022, when we \\ncelebrate 75 years of India’s independence: an India which is clean and \\nhealthy, where everybody would have a house with universal access to \\ntoilets, water and electricity; where farmers’ income would have doubled; \\nyouth and women would get ample opportunities to fulfil their dreams; \\nan India free from terrorism, communalism, casteism, corruption and \\nnepotism. \\n\\n\\nState of the Economy \\n\\n6. Madam Speaker, the last five years have seen India being \\nuniversally recognised as a bright spot of the global economy. The country \\nwitnessed its best phase of macro-economic stability during this period. \\nWe are the fastest growing major economy in the world with an annual \\naverage GDP growth during last five years higher than the growth achieved by \\nany Government since economic reforms began in 1991. From being the \\n11th largest economy in the world in 2013-14, we are today the 6th \\nlargest in the world. Besides generating high growth rate, we contained \\ndouble-digit inflation and restored fiscal balance. \\n7. Inflation is a hidden and unfair tax on the poor and the middle \\nclass. The average rate of inflation during 2009-2014 was a backbreaking \\n10.1%. The then Prime Minister admitted as much when he said, “We \\nhave also not been as successful in controlling persistent inflation as we \\nwould have wished. This is primarily because food inflation has increased.” \\nIn contrast, our Govt. broke the back of back-breaking inflation. We brought \\ndown average inflation to 4.6% which is lower than the inflation during \\nthe tenure of any other Government. In fact inflation in December 2018 \\nwas down to 2.19% only. If we had not controlled inflation, our families \\nwould have been spending around 35-40% more today on basic \\nnecessities such as food, travel, consumer durables, housing etc. \\n8. From the high of almost 6% seven years ago, the fiscal deficit has \\nbeen brought down to 3.4% in 2018-19 RE. The current account deficit \\n(CAD), against a high of 5.6% six years ago, is likely to be only 2.5% of \\nGDP this year. We contained the fiscal deficit notwithstanding the Finance \\nCommission\\'s recommendations increasing the share of the States from \\n32% to 42% in central taxes, which we accepted in the true spirit of \\ncooperative federalism, thereby transferring significantly higher amounts to \\nthe States. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n9. Due to a stable and predictable regulatory regime, growing \\neconomy and strong fundamentals, India could attract massive amount of \\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) during the last 5 years - as much as $239 \\nbillion. This period also witnessed a rapid liberalisation of the FDI policy, \\nallowing most FDI to come through the automatic route. \\n10. Madam Speaker, the last five years have witnessed a wave of next \\ngeneration structural reforms, which have set the stage for decades of \\nhigh growth. We have undertaken path breaking structural reforms by \\nintroducing Goods and Services Tax (GST) and other taxation reforms. \\n\\n\\nBanking Reforms and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) \\n\\n11. The period of 2008-14 will be remembered as a period of \\naggressive credit growth and, as per RBI, the primary reason for spurt in \\nnon-performing loans and stressed assets. Outstanding loans of public \\nsector banks ballooned from ` 18 lakh crore to ` 52 lakh crore during this \\nperiod. Many projects were started that could either not be completed or \\nhad low capacity utilisation resulting in their inability to pay back their \\nloans. There were high stressed and non-performing assets (NPAs) \\namounting to ` 5.4 lakh crore in 2014. Many more were hidden through \\nrestructuring or otherwise which were discovered during Asset Quality \\nReviews and inspections carried out since 2015. \\n12. We put a stop to such questionable practices and stopped the \\nculture of “phone banking”. The 4Rs approach of recognition, resolution, \\nre-capitalisation and reforms has been followed. A number of measures \\nhave been implemented to ensure Clean Banking. Through a transparent \\nand accountable process, we recognised these NPAs. The Insolvency and \\nBankruptcy Code has institutionalised a resolution-friendly mechanism, \\nwhich is helping in recovery of non-performing loans while preserving the \\nunderlying businesses and jobs. Earlier, only small businessmen used to be \\nunder pressure of repayment of loans while in the case of big businessmen, it \\nwas the headache of banks. But now, defaulting managements are either \\npaying or exiting their businesses. An amount of close to ` 3 lakh crore \\nhas already been recovered in favour of banks and creditors. To restore \\nthe health of public sector banks, recapitalisation has been done with an \\ninvestment of ` 2.6 lakh crore. Amalgamation of banks has also been done \\nto reap the benefits of economies of scale, improved access to capital and \\nto cover a larger geographical spread. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nSteps against corruption \\n\\n13. We have ushered in a new era of transparency. We have given a \\ncorruption free government. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) \\nAct, 2016 (RERA) and Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Act, 1988 are \\nhelping to bring transparency in the real estate sector. The Fugitive \\nEconomic Offenders Act, 2018 will help confiscate and dispose off the \\nassets of economic offenders who escape the jurisdiction of the laws in \\nIndia. Additionally, we conducted transparent auction of natural resources \\nincluding coal and spectrum. We have walked the talk. \\n\\n\\nCleanliness \\n\\n14. As a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary in 2019, \\nour Government initiated the world’s largest behavioural change \\nmovement with the Swachh Bharat Mission. India has achieved 98% rural \\nsanitation coverage and as many as 5.45 lakh villages have been declared \\n\"Open Defecation Free.\" It is a holistic programme and has succeeded in \\nchanging the mindset of our people. With the people participation, they \\ntransformed it from a Government Scheme to a national movement. I thank \\nthe 130 core people of the nation for the success of Swacch Bharat Abhiyan \\nwho adopted it whole heartedly. \\n\\n\\nPoor and backward classes \\n\\n15. The poor have the first right on the resources of the nation. The \\nGovernment while maintaining the existing reservation for SC/ST/Other \\nBackward Classes, have now ensured 10% reservation in educational \\ninstitutions and Government services for poors. In these institutions, around \\n25% extra seats (approximately 2 lakh) will be provided so that, there is no \\nshortfall of presently available/reserved seats for any class. \\n16. To provide food grains at affordable prices to the poor and middle \\nclasses, about `1,70,000 crores were spent in the year 2018-19 which is almost \\ndouble the amount of ` 92,000 crores spent in the year 2013-14. We ensured \\nthat everyone gets food and none goes to sleep hungry. `60,000 crores are \\nbeing allocated for MGNREGA in BE 2019-20. Additional amount would be \\nprovided if required. \\n17. We have worked to bridge the urban-rural divide in the country. \\nHon’ble Members in this August House, most of whom are from rural \\nareas, will agree that several times in the past, only empty promises have \\nbeen made to people living in our villages. During the last five years, we \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nhave undertaken targeted expenditure to improve their quality of life in \\nall its dimensions. Our aim, is to provide urban facilities in villages while \\nkeeping the soul of rural life intact. \\n18. Under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, construction of \\nrural roads has been tripled. 1.43 lakh habitations out of a total of 1.58 \\nlakh sanctioned habitations have already been connected with pucca roads \\nand work is going on to complete the rest very soon. Pradhan Mantri \\nGram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is being allocated ` 19,000 crore in BE 2019-\\n20 as against ` 15,500 crore in RE 2018-19. There was time when a child \\nused to reach school after walking on a foot trail, today the situation has \\nchanged and a bus can reach her/his village During the period 2014-18, a \\ntotal number of 1.53 crore houses have been built under the Pradhan \\nMantri Awas Yojana. \\n19. Till the year 2014, about 2.5 crore families were forced to live the life of \\n18th centuary without electricity. Under \\'Saubhagya Yojna\\', we provided free \\nelectricity connection to almost every household. By March, 2019, all willing \\nfamilies will get electricity connection. In mission mode, we have provided 143 \\ncrore LED bulbs with the participation of private sector. This has resulted into a \\nsavings of approximately ` 50,000 crore per year in electricity bills of poor and \\nmiddle class families. \\n20. Madam Speaker, past five years have seen massive scale up of \\nhealth care. Earlier, a poor man used to be in dilemma whether to fulfil daily \\nneeds of the family or save the life of an ailing member. This situation has \\ndeeply pained our Hon\\'ble Prime Minister. We launched the world’s largest \\nhealthcare programme, Ayushman Bharat, to provide medical treatment to \\nnearly 50 crore people. Already close to 10 lakh patients have benefited \\nfor medical treatment which would have cost them ` 3,000 crore through \\nfree treatment made available under the scheme. Lakhs of poor and middle \\nclass people are also benefiting from reduction in the prices of essential \\nmedicines, cardiac stents and knee implants, and availability of medicines \\nat affordable prices through Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendras. \\n21. There are 21 AIIMS operating or being established in the country \\npresently. 14 of these 21 AIIIMS have been announced since 2014. I am \\nhappy to announce setting up of new the 22nd AIIMS in Haryana. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n22. The Aspirational Districts Programme is providing targeted \\ndevelopment to the 115 most backward districts of the country. The \\nprogramme has achieved notable results with improved performance on \\nall indicators - health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water \\nresources, financial inclusion and skill development. \\n\\n\\nFarmer\\'s progress and Increase in Income \\n\\n23. Madam Speaker, our hard working farmers were not getting the full \\nvalue of their produce. With an aim to double the income of farmers, our \\nGovernment, for the first time in history has fixed the minimum support price \\n(MSP) of all 22 crops at minimum 50% more than the cost. \\n24. Agriculture continues to be the main driver of the rural economy. \\nOur hard-working farmers, supported by pro-farmer policies of our \\nGovernment in the past four and half years, have produced agriculture \\ncommodities in record quantities. Declining prices of agricultural \\ncommodities in the international market and fall in food inflation in India \\nsince 2017-18, relative to non-food sector, have however, reduced the \\nreturns from farming. Small and fragmented land holding on account of \\nrepeated divisions has also contributed in decline in the income of the \\nfarmer family. Hence, there is a need for providing structured income \\nsupport to the poor land-holder farmer families in the country for \\nprocuring inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, equipment, labour etc. and to \\nmeet other needs. Such support will help them in avoiding indebtedness \\nas well and falling into clutches of money lenders. \\n25. To provide an assured income support to the small and marginal \\nfarmers, our Government is launching a historic programme namely \\n“Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)”. Under this \\nprogramme, vulnerable landholding farmer families, having cultivable land \\nupto 2 hectares, will be provided direct income support at the rate of \\n`6,000 per year. This income support will be transferred directly into the \\nbank accounts of beneficiary farmers, in three equal instalments of ` 2,000 \\neach. This programme will be funded by Government of India. Around 12 \\ncrore small and marginal farmer families are expected to benefit from \\nthis. The programme would be made effective from 1st December 2018 \\nand the first instalment for the period upto 31st March 2019 would be \\npaid during this year itself. This programme will entail an annual \\nexpenditure of ` 75,000 crore. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n26. PM-KISAN would not only provide assured supplemental income to \\nthe most vulnerable farmer families, but would also meet their emergent \\nneeds especially before the harvest season. PM-KISAN would pave the \\nway for the farmers to earn and live a respectable living. \\n27. I propose an outlay of ` 75,000 crore for PM-KISAN for the \\nFY 2019-20. I am also providing ` 20,000 crore in the Revised Estimates of \\nFY 2018-19. \\n28. During the last five years, for providing affordable loans to farmers, the \\namount of interest subvention has been doubled. The crop loan to farmers \\nincreased to ` 11.68 lakh crore in year 2018-19. We have made genuine efforts \\nto remove the hardships of farmers by providing them Soil Health Cards, \\nquality seeds, irrigation scheme and Neem Coated Urea to remove shortage of \\nfertilizers. \\n29. Animal Husbandry and Fisheries sector also needs considerable \\nsupport. I have increased the allocation for Rashtriya Gokul Mission to `750 \\ncrore in the current year itself. I announce setting up of \"Rashtriya Kamdhenu \\nAayog\" to upscale sustainable genetic up-gradation of cow resources and \\nto enhance production and productivity of cows. The Aayog will also look \\nafter effective implementation of laws and welfare schemes for cows. \\n30. India is the second largest fish producing nation in the world \\naccounting for 6.3% of global production, registering an average annual \\ngrowth of more than 7% in recent years. The sector provides livelihood to \\nabout 1.45 crore people at the primary level. To provide sustained and \\nfocused attention towards development of this sector, our Government \\nhas decided to create a separate Department of Fisheries. \\n31. In the last Budget, our Government announced the facility of \\nextension of Kisan Credit Card scheme (KCC) to Animal Husbandry and \\nFisheries farmers. Now, I propose to provide the benefit of 2% interest \\nsubvention to the farmers pursuing the activities of animal husbandry and \\nfisheries, who avail loan through Kisan Credit Card. Further, in case of \\ntimely repayment of loan, they will also get an additional 3% interest \\nsubvention. \\n32. To ensure provision of easy and concessional credit and to bring all \\nfarmers under KCC fold, our Government has decided to initiate a \\ncomprehensive drive with a simplified application form. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n33. When natural calamities strike, farmers are generally unable to \\nrepay their crop loans. Presently, the crop loans are rescheduled for such \\naffected farmers and they get benefit of interest subvention of 2% only \\nfor the first year of the rescheduled loan. Our Government has now \\ndecided that all farmers affected by severe natural calamities, where \\nassistance is provided from National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF), will be \\nprovided the benefit of interest subvention of 2% and prompt repayment \\nincentive of 3% for the entire period of reschedulement of their loans. \\n\\n\\nLabour and Workers Dignity \\n\\n34. Madam Speaker, our Government firmly believes that workmen and all \\nthe people working in Government services should get benefit of the fast \\ngrowing economy. During the last five years India has witnessed industrial \\npeace. \\n35. High growth and formalistation of the economy has led to the \\nexpansion of employment opportunities as shown in EPFO membership, \\nwhich has increased by nearly 2 crore in two years reflecting formalisation \\nof the economy and job creations. \\n36. After submission of the 7th Central Pay Commission Report, the \\nrecommendations were implemented immediately. The New Pension Scheme \\n(NPS) has been liberalized. Keeping the contribution of the employee at 10%, \\nwe have increased the Government contribution by 4% making it 14%. \\nMaximum ceiling of the bonus given to the labourers has been increased from \\n` 3,500 pm to ` 7,000 pm and the maximum ceiling of the pay has been \\nincreased from ` 10,000 pm to ` 21,000 pm. The ceiling of payment of gratuity \\nhas been enhanced from ` 10 lakhs to ` 20 lakhs. During the last five years the \\nminimum wages of labourers of the all categories have been increased by 42%, \\nwhich is the highest ever. The ceiling of ESI\\'s eligibility cover has been \\nincreased from ` 15,000 pm to ` 21,000 pm. Minimum pension for every \\nlabourer has been fixed at ` 1,000 per month. In the event of death of a \\nlabourer during service, the amount to be paid by EPFO has been enhanced \\nfrom ` 2.5 lakh to ` 6 lakh. Under Anganwadi and Asha Yojana honorarium has \\nbeen enhanced by about 50% for all categories of workers. \\n37. Half of India’s GDP comes from the sweat and toil of 42 crore \\nworkers in the unorganised sector working as street vendors, rickshaw \\npullers, construction workers, rag pickers, agricultural workers, beedi \\nworkers, handloom, leather and in numerous other similar occupations. \\nDomestic workers are also engaged in big numbers. We must provide them \\ncomprehensive social security coverage for their old age. Therefore, in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\naddition to the health coverage provided under ‘Ayushman Bharat’ and \\nlife & disability coverage provided under ‘Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti \\nBima Yojana’ and ‘Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana’, our Government \\nproposes to launch a mega pension yojana namely \\'Pradhan Mantri \\nShram-Yogi Maandhan\\' for the unorganised sector workers with monthly \\nincome upto ` 15,000. This pension yojana shall provide them an assured \\nmonthly pension of ` 3,000 from the age of 60 years on a monthly \\ncontribution of a small affordable amount during their working age. An \\nunorganised sector worker joining pension yojana at the age of 29 years \\nwill have to contribute only ` 100 per month till the age of 60 years. A \\nworker joining the pension yojana at 18 years, will have to contribute as \\nlittle as ` 55 per month only. The Government will deposit equal matching \\nshare in the pension account of the worker every month. It is expected \\nthat at least 10 crore labourers and workers in the unorganised sector \\nwill avail the benefit of \\'Pradhan Mantri Shram-Yogi Maandhan\\' within \\nnext five years making it one of the largest pension schemes of the \\nworld. A sum of `500 crore has been allocated for the Scheme. Additional \\nfunds will be provided as needed. The scheme will also be implemented from \\nthe current year. \\n38. Our Government is committed to reach the most deprived citizens of \\nthis country. To this end, the condition of the De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-\\nNomadic communities merits special attention. These communities are hard to \\nreach, less visible, and therefore, frequently left out. The Nomadic and Semi-\\nNomadic communities move from place to place in search of a livelihood. The \\nRenke Commission and the Idate Commission have done commendable work \\nto identify and list these communities. A Committee under NITI Aayog will be \\nset up to complete the task of identifying De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-\\nNomadic communities not yet formally classified. Our Government will also set \\nup a Welfare Development Board under the Ministry of Social Justice and \\nEmpowerment specifically for the purpose of implementing welfare and \\ndevelopment programmes for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic \\ncommunities. The Board shall ensure that special strategies are designed and \\nimplemented to serve these hard-to-reach communities. \\n\\n\\nWomen’s development to women led development \\n\\n39. Madam Speaker, in our Election Manifesto, we had promised that \\nwe will transform the quality of life of women in rural India by providing \\ncleaner fuel. For securing the health of every home-maker in rural areas \\nand to ensure that she does not have to shed tears for cooking food to \\nnourish her family, our Government embarked upon a programme to \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ndeliver 8 crore free LPG connections under the Ujjwala Yojana. More than \\n6 crore connections have already been given and the remaining will get \\nfree gas connections by next year. Ujjwala is a remarkable success story of \\nour Government programme, defined by a bold yet practical Vision of a \\nresponsible and compassionate leadership. \\n40. More than 70% of the beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri MUDRA \\nYojana are women who are getting affordable and collateral-free loans to \\nstart their own businesses. Amongst many measures, benefits of Maternity \\nleave of 26 weeks and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana for \\npregnant women have provided financial support to women while \\nempowering them to participate in work. \\n\\n\\nEmpowering Youth to fulfil their potential \\n\\n41. India is amongst the most youthful nations in the world. Through \\nPradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, over 1 crore youth are being \\ntrained to help them earn a livelihood. We have harnessed ªÉÖ´ÉÉ ¶ÉÉÊkÉE \\nthrough self-employment schemes including MUDRA, Start-up India and \\nStand-up India. Under MUDRA Yojana 15.56 crore loans have been disbursed \\namounting to `7,23,000 crore. The concept of employment is changing all over \\nthe world, now the employment generation is not confined merely to \\nGovernment services or factories. With job seekers becoming job creators, \\nIndia has become the world’s second largest start-up hub. We are proud of \\nthe hard work and innovative ideas of our youth. \\n42. In order to take the benefits of Artificial Intelligence and related \\ntechnologies to the people, a National Programme on \\'Artificial Intelligence\\' \\nhas been envisaged by our Government. This would be catalysed by the \\nestablishment of the National Centre on Artificial Intelligence as a hub along \\nwith Centres of Excellence. Nine priority areas have been identified. A National \\nArtificial Intelligence portal will also be developed soon. \\n\\n\\nEmpowering MSMEs and Traders \\n\\n43. Government has undertaken many effective steps to strengthen MSME \\nsector, which provides employment to crores of people. Recently, a scheme of \\nsanctioning loans upto ` 1 crore in 59 minutes has been launched. GST-\\nregistered SME units will get 2% interest rebate on incremental loan of ` 1 \\nCrore. The requirement of sourcing from SMEs by Government enterprises has \\nbeen increased to 25%. Of this, the material to the extent of at least 3% will be \\nsourced from women owned SMEs. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n44. Government e-Marketplace (GeM), created by our Government two \\nyears ago, has transformed public procurement by making it fully \\ntransparent, inclusive and efficient. MSMEs have an opportunity to sell \\ntheir products through GeM. Transactions of over ` 17,500 crore have \\ntaken place, resulting in average savings of 25-28%. The GeM platform is \\nnow being extended to all CPSEs. \\n45. We have focussed on supporting domestic trade and services. Our \\nGovernment has recently assigned the subject of “promotion of internal \\ntrade including retail trading and welfare of traders, and their employees” \\nto the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, which will now be \\nrenamed as the Department for Promotion of Industries and Internal \\nTrade. \\n\\n\\nStrengthening Defence and National Security \\n\\n46. Madam Speaker, our soldiers protect our borders in tough \\nconditions. They are our pride and honour. We also respected their dignity. \\nIn our Election Manifesto, we had promised to implement One Rank One \\nPension (OROP). This was pending for the last 40 years and has been \\nresolved by us. The previous Governments announced it in three budgets \\nbut sanctioned a mere ` 500 crore in 2014-15 Interim Budget; in contrast \\nwe have already disbursed over ` 35,000 crore after implementing the \\nScheme in its\\' true spirit. The Government also announced substantial hike \\nin the Military Service Pay (MSP) of all service personnel and special \\nallowances given to Naval and Air Force personnel deployed in high risk \\nduties. \\n47. Our Defence Budget will be crossing ` 3,00,000 crore for the first time \\nin 2019-20. For securing our borders and to maintain preparedness of the \\nhighest order, if necessary, additional funds would be provided. \\n\\n\\nSupporting Indians across the world \\n\\n48. Today, all persons of Indian origin feel secure that their \\nmotherland Bharat cares for them and at times of need will support \\nthem. India’s transformation has inculcated a sense of pride and respect \\nfor Indians and persons of Indian origin across the globe. We have taken \\nseveral initiatives to strengthen their connect with India, facilitate their \\ninvestment in India and ease their travel. \\n\\n\\nInfrastructure development \\n\\n49. Infrastructure is the backbone of any nation’s development and \\nquality of life. Whether it is highways or railways or airways or even digi-\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nways, we have gone beyond incremental growth to attain transformative \\nachievements. \\n50. Because of \\'UDAAN Scheme\\', today an ordinary citizen is also travelling \\nby air. The number of operational airports has crossed 100 with the \\ncommissioning of the Pakyong airport in Sikkim. Domestic passenger traffic \\nhas doubled during the last five years leading to large number of jobs \\nbeing created also. Today, India is the fastest highway developer in the \\nworld with 27 kms of highways built each day. Projects stuck for decades \\nlike the Eastern Peripheral Highway around Delhi or the Bogibeel rail-cum-\\nroad bridge in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh have been completed. The \\nflagship programme of Sagarmala along the coastal areas of the country \\nwill develop ports for faster handling of import and export cargo. For the \\nfirst time, container freight movement has started on inland waterways \\nfrom Kolkata to Varanasi. Our Government will introduce container cargo \\nmovement to the North East as well, by improving the navigation capacity \\nof the Brahmaputra river. \\n51. Indian Railways has experienced the safest year in its history. All \\nUnmanned Level Crossings on broad gauge network have been eliminated. \\nIntroduction of the first indigenously developed and manufactured semi \\nhigh-speed \"Vande Bharat Express\" will give the Indian passengers world \\nclass experience with speed, service and safety. This major leap in wholly \\ndeveloped technology by our engineers will give an impetus to the Make \\nin India programme and create jobs. Capital support from the budget for \\nrailways is proposed at ` 64,587 crore in 2019-20 (BE). The Railways’ \\noverall capital expenditure programme is of ` 1,58,658 crore. The \\nOperating Ratio is expected to improve from 98.4% in 2017-18 to 96.2% \\nin 2018-19 (RE) and further to 95% in 2019-20 (BE). \\n52. India provided leadership to the global effort to address the \\nproblem of climate change. Our commitment to promote renewable \\nenergy is reflected in setting up the International Solar Alliance, the first \\ntreaty based international inter-governmental organisation headquartered \\nin India. India’s installed solar generation capacity has grown over ten \\ntimes in last five years. This sector is now creating lakhs of new age \\njobs. \\n53. India\\'s import dependence on crude oil and natural gas has been a \\nsource of big concern to our Government. While we have taken a large number \\nof measures to moderate the increasing demand through usage of bio fuel and \\nalternate technologies, urgent action is needed to increase hydrocarbon \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nproduction to reduce imports. A high level Inter-Ministerial Committee, \\nconstituted by our Government, has made several specific recommendations, \\nincluding transforming the system of bidding for exploration, changing from \\nrevenue sharing to exploration programme for Category II and III basins. The \\nGovernment is in the process of implementing these recommendations. \\n54. The people of North East have also received significant benefits of \\ninfrastructure development. Arunachal Pradesh came on the air map \\nrecently and Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram have come on India’s rail \\nmap for the first time. Allocation for the North Eastern Areas is being \\nproposed to be increased by 21% to ` 58,166 crore in 2019-20 BE over \\n2018-19 BE. \\n\\n\\nDigital India Revolution \\n\\n55. Madam Speaker, India is now leading the world in the \\nconsumption of mobile data. Monthly consumption of mobile data \\nincreased by over 50 times in the last five years. The cost of data and \\nvoice calls in India is now possibly the lowest in the world. Today, under \\nMake in India, mobile and parts manufacturing companies have increased \\nfrom 2 to more than 268 providing huge job opportunities. More than 3 \\nlakh Common Service Centres (CSCs) employing about 12 lakh people, are \\ndigitally delivering several services to the citizens. The Common Service \\nCentres are expanding their services and also creating digital infrastructure in \\nthe villages, including connectivity, to convert the villages into Digital Villages. \\nThe Government will make 1 lakh villages into Digital Villages over next five \\nyears. \\n56. Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) and Direct Benefit Transfer have \\nbeen game changers. Bank nationalisation was first done 50 years ago, \\nbut a large part of the country was still left out of the economic \\nmainstream with no access to formal banking. In the last five years, \\nnearly 34 crore Jan Dhan bank accounts were opened. Aadhaar is now \\nnear universally implemented. This has helped ensure the poor and \\nmiddle class receive the benefits of Government schemes directly in their \\nbank accounts by eliminating middlemen. \\n\\n\\nEntertainment \\n\\n57. Entertainment industry is a major employment generator. To \\npromote entertainment industry - Single window clearance for ease of \\nshooting films, available only to foreigners, is now going to be made \\navailable to Indian filmmakers as well. Regulatory provisions will rely more \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\non self-declaration. We will also introduce anti-camcording provisions in \\nthe Cinematograph Act to control the menace of piracy. \\n\\n\\nSimplification of Direct Tax System to benefit Tax-payers \\n\\n58. Madam Speaker, for making the life of our direct tax-payers easy, \\nwe reduced tax rates, more for the common man and middle class, and \\nmade the interface with the tax department much simpler and largely \\nfaceless. Due to this, the tax collections increased significantly from ` 6.38 \\nLakh crore in 2013-14 to almost ` 12 lakh crore this year. The number \\nof returns filed have also increased from 3.79 crore to 6.85 crore showing \\n80% growth in tax base. I thank the honest taxpayers of India for \\nreposing faith in our Government. Let me assure them that we have used \\ntheir contribution to serve the poor and create better infrastructure. \\n59. The Income Tax Department now functions online. Returns, \\nassessments, refunds and queries are all undertaken online. Last year, \\n99.54% of the income-tax returns were accepted as they were filed. Our \\nGovernment has now approved a path breaking, technology intensive \\nproject to transform the Income-tax Department into a more assessee-\\nfriendly one. All returns will be processed in twenty-four hours and \\nrefunds issued simultaneously. Within the next two years, almost all \\nverification and assessment of returns selected for scrutiny will be done \\nelectronically through anonymised back office, manned by tax experts and \\nofficials, without any personal interface between taxpayers and tax officers. \\n60. Reducing the tax burden on middle class has always been our \\npriority ever since our Government took over in 2014. We increased the \\nbasic exemption limit from ` 2 lakh to ` 2.5 Lakh and gave tax rebate so \\nthat no tax was payable by persons having income up to ` 3 lakh. We \\nalso reduced the tax rate from 10% to 5% for the tax slab of ` 2.5 lakh to \\n` 5 lakh and introduced Standard Deduction of ` 40,000 for the salaried \\nclass. Deduction of savings under section 80C was increased from \\n` 1 lakh to ` 1.5 lakh. Deduction of interest for self-occupied house \\nproperty was raised from ` 1.5 lakh to ` 2 lakh. \\n61. Special benefits and incentives were also given to small businesses \\nand start-ups. Overall compliance processes were simplified. Threshold \\nlimit for presumptive taxation of business was raised from \\n` 1 crore to ` 2 crore. The benefit of presumptive taxation was extended \\nfor the first time to small professionals fixing threshold limit at ` 50 lakh. \\nIn order to promote a less cash economy, the presumptive profit rate has \\nbeen reduced from 8% to 6%. The tax rate for companies with turnover \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nof up to ` 250 crore, covering almost 99% of the companies, was reduced \\nto 25% which was also applicable to new manufacturing companies \\nwithout any turnover limits. \\n\\n\\nGST Reform for benefit to consumers and businesses \\n\\n62. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms lingered on during the \\nprevious Government for almost a decade. Our Government implemented \\nthe GST, which is undoubtedly the biggest taxation reform undertaken \\nsince Independence. Seventeen different taxes levied by the Central and \\nState/UT Governments with cascading effect of tax on tax, were \\nconsolidated into one GST. India became a common market. GST has \\nresulted in increased tax base, higher collections and ease of trade. This \\nwill reduce the interface between the tax payer and the Government for \\nday-to-day operations and assessments. Now returns are fully online and \\ne-way bill system is in place. Inter-state movements have become faster, \\nmore efficient, and hassle free with no Entry Tax, check posts, and truck \\nqueues. \\n63. The high taxation levied on multiple commodities in the pre-GST \\nregime has been rationalised and the burden on the consumer, especially \\nthe poor and the middle class, has been significantly reduced. The GST \\nCouncil, comprising the Centre and States/UTs, finalised the GST rates \\ncollectively mostly lower than pre-GST rates. Since then, GST has been \\ncontinuously reduced providing relief of about ` 80,000 crore annually to \\nconsumers. Most items of daily use of the poor and middle class are now \\nin the 0% or 5% tax slab. Cinema goers who were subjected to multiple \\ntaxes up to 50% are mostly paying much lower tax at 12% now. Our \\nGovernment wants the GST burden on home buyers to be reduced and \\naccordingly we have moved the GST Council to appoint a Group of \\nMinisters to examine and make recommendations in this regard at the \\nearliest. \\n64. GST aims to benefit small traders, manufacturers and service \\nproviders. Exemptions from GST for small businesses has been doubled \\nfrom ` 20 lakh to ` 40 lakh. Further, small businesses having turnover up \\nto ` 1.5 crore have been given an attractive composition scheme wherein \\nthey pay only 1% flat rate and have to file one annual return only. \\nSimilarly, small service providers with turnover upto `50 lakhs can now opt \\nfor composition scheme and pay GST at 6% instead of 18%. More than 35 \\nlakh small traders, manufacturers and service providers will benefit from \\nthese trader friendly measures. Soon, businesses comprising over 90% of \\nGST payers will be allowed to file quarterly return. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n65. In spite of such major rate reductions and relaxations, revenue \\ntrends are encouraging. The average monthly tax collection in the current \\nyear is ` 97,100 crore per month as compared to ` 89,700 crore per \\nmonth in the first year. The State revenues are improving with \\nguaranteed 14% annual revenue increase for the first five years. \\n\\n\\nCustoms and Trading Across Border Reforms \\n\\n66. To promote the “Make in India” initiative, we have undertaken \\nrationalization of customs duties and procedures. Our Government has \\nabolished duties on 36 capital goods. A revised system of importing duty-\\nfree capital goods and inputs for manufacture and export has been \\nintroduced, along with introduction of single point of approval under \\nsection 65 of the Customs Act. Indian Customs is introducing full and \\ncomprehensive digitalization of export/import transactions and leveraging \\nRFID technology to improve export logistics. \\n\\n\\nDemonetisation and Drive against Black Money \\n\\n67. Our Government is committed to eliminating the ills of black \\nmoney from our country. The anti-black money measures taken by us \\nduring the last four and half years in the form of Black Money Law, the \\nFugitive Criminal Offenders Act, and Demonetisation, have brought \\nundisclosed income of about ` 1,30,000 crore to tax, led to seizure and \\nattachment of assets worth approximately ` 50,000 crore, and compelled \\nholders of large cash currency to disclose their source of earnings. During \\nthis period, Benami assets worth ` 6,900 crore and foreign assets worth \\n`1,600 crore have been attached. As many as 3,38,000 shell companies \\nhave been detected and de-registered, and their directors disqualified. \\nGrowth of 18% in direct tax collection in 2017-18 and increase in tax \\nbase by as many as 1.06 crore people filing income tax returns for the \\nfirst time in FY 2017-18 is mainly on account of demonetization. \\n\\n\\nVision for the next Decade \\n\\n68. Madam Speaker, the NDA Government headed by Hon\\'ble Prime \\nMinister Shri Narendra Modi has laid the foundation for India’s growth \\nand development for times to come. We have resolved many problems \\nwhich were coming in the way of realising our full potential as a society \\nand an economy. We are poised to become a Five Trillion Dollar Economy \\nin the next five years and aspire to become a Ten Trillion Dollar Economy \\nin the next 8 years thereafter. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n69. In the Indian ethos, anything which is good is supposed to bestow, \\ncause, create and do good in all ten directions. I will, therefore, layout our \\nvision for ten most important dimensions in 2030. \\n70. The First Dimension of this Vision will be to build physical as well \\nas social infrastructure for a ten Trillion Dollar economy and to provide \\nease of living. It will comprise next generation infrastructure of roads, \\nrailways, seaports, airports, urban transport, gas and electric transmission \\nand inland waterways. On the social infrastructure side, every family will \\nhave a roof on its head and will live in a healthy, clean and wholesome \\nenvironment. We will also build a quality, science oriented educational system \\nwith Institutes of Excellence providing leadership at the top. \\n71. The Second dimension of our Vision is to create a Digital India \\nreaching every sector of the economy, every corner of the country and \\nimpacting the life of all Indians. Digital Infrastructure and digital economy \\nof 2030 will be built upon the successes achieved in recent years in \\ndigitisation of Government processes and private transactions. Our youth \\nwill lead us in this endeavour with innumerable start-ups creating digital \\nIndia, and millions of jobs in this eco-system. \\n72. Making India a pollution free nation with green Mother Earth and \\nblue skies is the Third Dimension of our Vision. This India will drive on \\nElectric Vehicles with Renewables becoming a major source of energy \\nsupply. India will lead the world in the transport revolution through \\nelectric vehicles and energy storage devices, bringing down import-\\ndependence and ensuring energy security for our people. \\n73. Expanding rural industrialisation using modern digital technologies \\nto generate massive employment is the Fourth Dimension of our Vision. \\nThis will be built upon the Make in India approach to develop grass-roots \\nlevel clusters, structures and mechanisms encompassing the MSMEs, \\nvillage industries and start-ups spread in every nook and corner of the \\ncountry. India is now on the way to becoming a global manufacturing hub \\nin various sectors including automobiles and electronics, defence and \\nmedical devices. \\n74. Our rivers and water bodies are our life supporting assets. Our \\nGovernment has worked vigorously for cleaning River Ganga. Fifth \\nDimension of our Vision for India of 2030 is Clean Rivers, with safe \\ndrinking water to all Indians, sustaining and nourishing life and efficient \\nuse of water in irrigation using micro-irrigation techniques. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n75. India’s long coastline has the potential of becoming the strength \\nof the economy, particularly through exploitation of the Blue Economy, to \\nensure better standards and quality of life for a large number of people \\nliving in the coastal areas. Our efforts in the Sagarmala programme will be \\nscaled up and we will develop other inland waterways faster. Our \\ncoastline and our ocean waters powering India’s development and growth \\nis the Sixth Dimension of our Vision. \\n76. The Seventh Dimension of our Vision aims at the outer skies. Our \\nspace programme – Gaganyaan, India becoming the launch-pad of \\nsatellites for the World and placing an Indian astronaut into space by \\n2022 reflect this dimension of our vision. \\n77. Making India self-sufficient in food, exporting to the world to meet \\ntheir food needs and producing food in the most organic way is the \\nEighth Dimension of our Vision. High farm production and productivity will \\nbe achieved through modern agricultural practices and value addition. An \\nintegrated approach towards agro and food processing, preservation, \\npackaging and maintenance of the cold chain will be our focus of \\nattention. \\n78. A healthy India is the Ninth Dimension of our Vision. We will be \\naiming at healthy society with an environment of health assurance and the \\nsupport of necessary health infrastructure. Our Government has rolled out \\nthe Ayushman Bharat scheme. By 2030, we will work towards a distress \\nfree health care and a functional and comprehensive wellness system for \\nall. Such a healthy India built with the participation of women having equal \\nrights and concern for their safety and empowerment. \\n79. Our Vision can be delivered by Team India - our employees \\nworking together with the elected Government, transforming India into a \\nMinimum Government Maximum Governance nation. This is the Tenth \\nDimension. Our India of 2030 will have a proactive and responsible \\nbureaucracy which will be viewed as friendly to people. \\n80. With this comprehensive ten-dimensional Vision, we will create an \\nIndia where poverty, malnutrition, littering and illiteracy would be a \\nmatter of the past. India would be a modern, technology driven, high \\ngrowth, equitable and transparent society. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nThe Fiscal Programme for 2019-20 and beyond \\n\\n81. The estimate of incomes and expenditure which I am presenting \\ntoday, pegs the fiscal deficit of year 2019-20 at 3.4% of GDP. We would \\nhave maintained fiscal deficit at 3.3% for year 2018-19 and taken further steps \\nto consolidate fiscal deficit in year 2019-20. However, considering the need for \\nincome support to farmers we have provided ` 20,000 crore in 2018-19 RE and \\n` 75,000 crore in 2019-20 BE. If we exclude this, the fiscal deficit would have \\nbeen less than 3.3% for 2018-19 and less than 3.1% for year 2019-20. \\n82. Total expenditure rises from ` 24,57,235 crore in 2018-19 RE to \\n`27,84,200 crore in 2019-20 BE, a rise of `3,26,965 crore or \\napproximately 13.30%. This reflect a high increase considering low inflation. \\nCapital Expenditure for 2019-20 BE is estimated to be ` 3,36,292 crore. \\nCentrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are proposed to be allocated `3,27,679 \\ncrore in BE 2019-20 as against ` 3,04,849 crore in 2018-19 RE. Allocation \\nfor National Education Mission is being increased from ` 32,334 crore in \\nRE 2018-19 to ` 38,572 crore in BE 2019-20. Allocation for Integrated \\nChild Development Scheme (ICDS) is being increased from ` 23,357 crore \\nin RE 2018-19 to ` 27,584 crore in BE 2019-20. \\n83. A substantial increase is proposed in the allocation for welfare of \\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The allocation of ` 56,619 crore \\nmade in BE of 2018-19 for Scheduled Caste, further increased to ` 62,474 \\ncrore in RE is proposed to be enhanced to ` 76,801 crore in BE for 2019-\\n20, an increase of 35.6% over BE of 2018-19. For the Scheduled Tribes \\nalso, proposed allocation in 2019-20 BE is ` 50,086 crore as against \\n`39,135 crore in BE 2018-19, an increase of 28%. \\n84. We have pursued the public enterprises asset management agenda \\nto make these enterprises accountable to the people. As many as 57 \\nCPSEs are now listed with total market capitalisation of over ` 13 lakh \\ncrore. The Government received over ` 1 lakh crore from disinvestment \\nproceeds during 2017-18. We are confident of crossing the target of \\n`80,000 crore this year. \\n85. We have maintained the glide path towards our target of 3% of \\nfiscal deficit to be achieved by 2020-21. India’s Debt to GDP ratio was \\n46.5% in year 2017-18. The FRBM Act prescribes that the Debt to GDP \\nratio of the Government of India should be brought down to 40% by \\n2024-25. Along with completion of the fiscal deficit consolidation \\nprogramme, we will now focus on Debt consolidation. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n86. Our Government had promised last year that we will carry out \\nreforms in stamp duty levied and collected on financial securities \\ntransactions. I am proposing, through the Finance Bill, necessary \\namendments in this regard. The amendments proposed would usher in a \\nvery streamlined system. Stamp duties would be levied on one instrument \\nrelating to one transaction and get collected at one place through the \\nStock Exchanges. The duty so collected will be shared with the State \\nGovernments seamlessly on the basis of domicile of buying client. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c\\n \\n\\nPART B: \\n\\nTax Proposals \\n\\n87. On behalf of all the people of India and our Government, I would first \\nlike to thank all our taxpayers for their valuable contribution to nation building \\nand for providing a better life to the poor and marginalized sections of society. \\nYour tax helps provide dignity to our sisters and mothers with toilets and \\ncooking gas connections. Your tax pays for the electricity connections to the \\npoor who lived in darkness for generations. The tax you pay will provide health \\ncare to 50 crore brothers and sisters, and children. It is you who is ensuring \\nrespect, dignity, and a secure future to our retired jawans through One Rank \\nOne Pension. Thank you, taxpayers. \\n88. Because of major tax reforms undertaken by us during the last four and \\nhalf years, both tax collections as well as the tax base have shown significant \\nincrease and we have made progress towards achieving a moderate taxation–\\nhigh compliance regime. It is, therefore, just and fair that some benefits from \\nthe tax reforms must also be passed on to the middle class taxpayers. Keeping \\nthis in view, I propose to further reduce the tax burden on such taxpayers. \\nThough as per convention, the main tax proposals will be presented in the \\nregular budget, small taxpayers especially middle class, salary earners, \\npensioners, and senior citizens need certainty in their minds at the beginning \\nof the year about their taxes. Therefore, proposals, particularly relating to such \\nclass of persons should not wait. Hence, while for the present the existing \\nrates of income tax will continue for FY 2019-20, I propose the following: \\n89. Individual taxpayers having taxable annual income up to ` 5 lakhs will \\nget full tax rebate and therefore will not be required to pay any income tax. As \\na result, even persons having gross income up to ` 6.50 lakhs may not be \\nrequired to pay any income tax if they make investments in provident funds, \\nspecified savings, insurance etc. In fact, with additional deductions such as \\ninterest on home loan up to ` 2 lakh, interest on education loans, National \\nPension Scheme contributions, medical insurance, medical expenditure on \\nsenior citizens etc, persons having even higher income will not have to pay any \\ntax. This will provide tax benefit of ` 18,500 crore to an estimated 3 crore \\nmiddle class taxpayers comprising self employed, small business, small \\ntraders, salary earners, pensioners and senior citizens. \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n90. For salaried persons, Standard Deduction is being raised from the \\ncurrent ` 40,000 to ` 50,000. This will provide additional tax benefit of \\n` 4,700 crore to more than 3 crore salary earners and pensioners. \\n91. Currently, income tax on notional rent is payable if one has more than \\none self-occupied house. Considering the difficulty of the middle class having \\nto maintain families at two locations on account of their job, children’s \\neducation, care of parents etc. I am proposing to exempt levy of income tax on \\nnotional rent on a second self-occupied house. \\n92. TDS threshold on interest earned on bank/post office deposits is being \\nraised from ` 10,000 to ` 40,000. This will benefit small depositors and non-\\nworking spouses. Further, the TDS threshold for deduction of tax on rent is \\nproposed to be increased from ` 1,80,000 to ` 2,40,000 for providing relief to \\nsmall taxpayers. \\n93. The benefit of rollover of capital gains under section 54 of the Income \\nTax Act will be increased from investment in one residential house to two \\nresidential houses for a tax payer having capital gains up to ` 2 crore. This \\nbenefit can be availed once in a life time. \\n94. For making more homes available under affordable housing, the \\nbenefits under Section 80-IBA of the Income Tax Act is being extended for one \\nmore year, i.e. to the housing projects approved till 31st March, 2020. \\n95. Also, for giving impetus to the real estate sector, I have proposed to \\nextend the period of exemption from levy of tax on notional rent, on unsold \\ninventories, from one year to two years, from the end of the year in which the \\nproject is completed. \\n\\n\\nConcluding Remarks \\n\\n96. Madam Speaker, This is not merely an Interim Budget, but a medium of \\nthe country\\'s development journey. All the transformation that we are \\nwitnessing, is because of the passion of the people of our nation. The credit \\ngoes to them only. Development has become a mass-movement during the \\nperiod of our Government. \\n97. We will transform India into a leading nation of the world with the help \\nof our people. We, along with them have laid the foundation. A grand edifice \\nwill be erected with their support. We have given a decisive leadership, whose \\nintent is clear, policy is transparent and integrity is resolute. \\n98. With this, I commend the Budget to this august House.', 'Budget \\n2019-2020 \\n\\n\\nSpeech \\nof \\nNirmala \\nSitharaman \\n\\n\\nMinister \\nof \\nFinance \\n\\n\\nJuly \\n5, \\n2019 \\n\\n\\nMr.
